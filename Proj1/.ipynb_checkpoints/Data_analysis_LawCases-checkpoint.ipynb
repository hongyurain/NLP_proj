      "['JUDGMENT  Introduction   \\t \\tOn 28 October 2016 Mr Brewer, counsel for the accused, objected to the Crown adducing certain evidence from Fiona Wilkie and submitted that it ought be excluded pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.', 'The evidence to which objection was taken was derived from [80] of Ms Wilkie’s statement to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) dated 28 February 2011, which said as follows: \\t   “Also during this meeting [in late 2008 or early 2009], either Mr Fornasaro or I queried with Mr Sigalla various loans that appeared in account ‘2-4193 TZ Limited’ of the client MYOB General Ledger of the Sigalla Family Trust for the financial year commencing 1 July 2008.', 'Mr Fornasaro or I said words to the effect;  “What is this account?” and “What are these loans for?”  Mr Sigalla said to Mr Fornasaro and I words to the effect;  “Sometimes we have to artificially inflate the price of TZL.', 'I tell my mates to do it too.', 'Sometimes I borrow money to buy shares for myself, and sometimes I get money from friends to buy shares on their behalf.””   \\t \\tI allowed the evidence as I did not consider that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and indicated that I would provide reasons for my ruling later.', 'I note that when the jury returned and Ms Wilkie was asked about the conversation with the accused, the following exchange ensued: \\t   “Q.', 'I asked you about the conversation which was in about late 2008/early 2009 in which Mr\\xa0Sigalla was asked \"what\\'s the account?', 'What are the loans for?\"', 'He provided you with an answer?', 'A.', 'Yes.', 'Q.', 'What did he say?', 'A.', 'From my recollection, the answer was that basically people he knew and other parties to TZL would trade in shares of TZL to influence the market value of the shares on the stock exchange.”   \\t \\tThe answer given by Ms Wilkie did not go as far as her proof of evidence set out above, in which the accused is said to have said: “Sometimes we have to artificially inflate.', '.', '.” The actual evidence adduced made the ruling, in effect, hypothetical.', 'Nonetheless, the accused is entitled to reasons for my allowing the evidence, which are set out below.', 'Consideration   \\t \\tThe context in which the evidence was sought to be led is important to an assessment of its probative value.', 'Ms Wilkie was being questioned about a document, Exhibit R, which was sent as an attachment to an email from Ms Wilkie to Ms Kitnar, the book keeper for the accused, his wife and his companies (ZMS Investments Pty Ltd and BZI Pty Ltd).', 'The attachment comprised a balance sheet of BZI Pty Ltd as of June 2009 and profit and loss statement for the financial year ended 30 June 2009 and the BZI Pty Ltd general ledger for that period.', 'Of present importance, Ms Wilkie was being asked about a particular item in the general ledger, 2-4193, entitled “TZ Ltd”.', 'Ms Wilkie explained that this item was a liability and comprised amounts owed by BZI Pty Ltd to TZ Ltd. She was asked about an item in the general ledger for 18 August 2008 recorded as “TZ John Falconer $525,000”.', 'In response she said that the item reflected that BZI Pty Ltd owed Mr Falconer money for the acquisition of shares in TZ Ltd. She was then asked whether she attended a meeting with the accused in late 2008 or early 2009 in which this account was discussed, to which she answered in the affirmative.', 'The Crown then sought to lead the conversation set out in the extract above and in particular the accused’s response to the inquiry about the loans.', 'Count 14 of the indictment charges that the accused on 18 August 2008 used his position as a director of TZ Ltd dishonestly with the intention of directly gaining a benefit for BZI Pty Ltd and himself in that he caused $525,000 of funds of TZ Ltd to be transferred to BZI Pty Ltd.', 'The content of the conversation regarding the item is plainly relevant, at least to count 14.', 'If the accused’s description of the particular entry was true, it amounts to an admission.', 'If it was not true, it is capable of amounting to an implied admission and could be used by the jury to infer dishonesty (which is part of the charge).', 'It is prejudicial to the accused since his answer tends to indicate that he engaged in uncharged conduct (in effect, market manipulation or covert action concerning shares) which is both dishonest and criminal and bears a certain similarity with the underlying conduct which forms the background to the charges in the indictment.', 'Section 137 requires the probative value of evidence to be weighed against the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused of adducing the evidence.', 'Mr Brewer accepted that the evidence was probative but argued that there was a danger of unfair prejudice because of its tendency to indicate that he engaged in other nefarious, and related, conduct.', 'If it were feasible to sever the part of the accused’s answer (in Ms Wilkie’s statement) which relates to market manipulation, the prejudice could be removed.', 'However, the purpose of the loans is, in my view, crucial to the characterisation of them given by the accused.', 'Accordingly, the probative force of the evidence would be significantly reduced if what the accused said by way of explanation of the entry could not be adduced in full.', 'I accept the Crown’s submission that the evidence is highly probative to count 14 in that it is a broadly contemporaneous explanation by the accused of the accounting treatment of the sum referred to in count 14.', 'I consider that any danger of unfair prejudice to the accused of the evidence objected to could be ameliorated by an appropriate direction to the jury as to the limited use to which they could put what the accused said to Ms Wilkie and Mr Fornasaro.', 'I do not regard the probative value of this evidence as being outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.', 'In these circumstances I am not obliged by s 137 of the Evidence Act to exclude the evidence.', 'Nor am I persuaded that it would be appropriate to exclude the evidence on any other basis.', 'Section 136 must also be considered since it provides for a discretion to limit the use of evidence which is unfairly prejudicial to a party.', 'Had Ms Wilkie come up to proof (and said that the accused included himself in the persons said to engage in such conduct), it would have been necessary to limit the use to which the evidence could be put and direct the jury accordingly.', 'However, as she did not, it was not necessary to give any such direction to the jury, as was accepted by Mr Brewer after the evidence had been led.', 'Ruling   \\t \\tOn 28 October 2016 I made the following ruling on the voir dire: \\t    \\t \\tI allow evidence to be given by Ms Wilkie of the conversation in [80] of her statement to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission dated 28 February 2011.', '**********   \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t

which the respondent had suffered facial injuries.', 'The respondent was charged with maliciously wounding the security guard with intent to do grievous bodily harm, under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).', 'On 1 February 2008, the respondent appeared before Tupman DCJ in the District Court at Sydney on a plea of guilty.', 'He was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years to be served by way of periodic detention.', 'Her Honour permitted a discount of 1/3 from what would otherwise have been the appropriate sentence (a discount of 20% for the guilty plea and a further discount of 13.3% for contrition and remorse and a weak Crown case on the element of intent).', 'On 13 February 2008, the Director of Public Prosecutions filed a notice of appeal, challenging the sentence as manifestly inadequate.The issues for determination on appeal were:(i) whether the additional discount of 13.3% was excessive or involved double counting of mitigation factors in sentencing;(ii) whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate; and(iii) if so, whether the Court should intervene.The Court held, dismissing the appeal:In relation to (i)(per Basten JA, Barr and Buddin JJ agreeing)1.', 'The suggestion that there is necessarily error in identifying a proportionate discount for factors other than the utilitarian value of a plea is to adopt an overly mechanical rule: [22].2.', 'Whilst potentially being transparent, the provision of an arithmetical deduction for mitigating factors in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) may be misleading and may result in “double counting”: [22]–[23].', 'R v MAK; R v MSK           [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159, considered.', 'Markarian v The Queen           [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357, referred to.', '3.', 'Since it was accepted as a fact that the respondent’s guilty plea warranted a finding of remorse and contrition and this was enhanced by the weak Crown case on intent, a degree of alteration of the sentence was justified.', 'Moreover, it was not demonstrated that the 13.3% additional discount was erroneous because it involved “double counting” or took the sentence outside the appropriate range: [23].In relation to (ii)(Basten JA, Barr and Buddin JJ agreeing)4.', 'It is inappropriate to “tailor” sentences so that they can be served by way of periodic detention.', 'Independently of the assertion of manifest inadequacy, there was no basis for suggesting that course had been taken: [25].', 'Regina v Zamagias           [2002] NSWCCA 17, referred to.', '5.', 'An assessment of whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate must be made in light of her Honour’s findings, which the Director did not challenge: [31].6.', 'The sentencing judge is responsible for characterising the objective seriousness of an offence.', 'The Court of Appeal is slow to set aside that assessment or independently determine such matters, and should only consider whether the primary judge’s characterisation of the circumstances was open: [31].', 'Mulato v Regina           [2006] NSWCCA 282, followed.', 'Regina v Deng           [2007] NSWCCA 216;

the early hours of 1 October 2006, the respondent was involved in an altercation with a security guard outside a nightclub in Kings Cross.', 'He took out a knife, with which he stabbed the guard in the neck.', 'He was subsequently charged with maliciously wounding the guard with intent to do grievous bodily harm, under s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).', 'On 1 February 2008, he appeared before Tupman DCJ in the District Court at Sydney on a plea of guilty and was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 2 years to be served by way of periodic detention.', 'On 13 February 2008, the Director filed a notice of appeal, challenging the sentence as manifestly inadequate.', 'Basis of challenge2 The right of appeal is conferred on the Director by s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).', 'The Criminal Appeal Rules require that where an offender seeks to appeal against conviction or seeks leave to appeal against sentence, the notice of appeal must be accompanied by a statement of the grounds for appeal and written submissions in support of the appeal: r 23C.', 'No such requirements apply to an appeal by the Director under s 5D: r 23E.', 'Nor is there any requirement that the Director file written submissions or serve them on the offender, within any specified period or at all.', '3 It is common in practice for the Director to file a notice of appeal without any grounds being specified beyond a generic description such as “manifest inadequacy” and for the written submissions to follow sometime later, often without any precise identification of the grounds.', 'In the present case, the notice of appeal was dated 13 February 2008, but the Director’s written submissions were dated 22 March 2008.', 'The submissions were 22 paragraphs in length, the first 15 paragraphs being devoted to setting out the background and the sentence.', 'It was left to this Court to glean, as best it could, the basis of the appeal.', '4 Where the gravamen of the challenge is that the resulting sentence is simply outside the permissible range, given the objective criminality found by the trial judge, and given the subjective circumstances of the offender, the ground may not be susceptible to more precise particularisation.', 'On the other hand, where some specific complaint is made about the sentencing process or the judgment, that should be particularised and the respondent should be given early notice of the grounds to be relied upon.', 'Failure to do so will ordinarily be a matter relevant to the exercise of discretion in determining whether to intervene.', '5 In the present case, the submissions assayed two tasks.', 'The first was merely to elaborate upon the proposition that the sentence was manifestly inadequate and failed to reflect the objective criminality of the offence.', 'The second was directed specifically to the allowance of “an additional discount of approximately 13.3% for contrition and remorse, and a ‘plea to an otherwise weak Crown case on the element of intent’”.', 'The additional discount appears to have been challenged in two ways: first, it was said to be excessive; secondly, it was said to be inappropriate to provide a “rolled-up discount … contrary to decisions of this Court [in] R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [41]-[42]”.', '6 No challenge was made, either in the written submissions or orally, to the findings of primary fact made by the sentencing judge, nor to the inferences drawn from those facts.', 'Circumstances of offence7 Before evaluating the challenges outlined above, it is convenient to set out some further background to the offence and to note the findings made by the sentencing judge and her Honour’s reasons for adopting particular inferences in relation to the offender’s conduct.', '8 The relevant events of the night in question commenced when the respondent and at least one friend went to the Dragonfly nightclub in Earl Place, Kings Cross.', 'They arrived at about 2.15am, having previously attended a party in the city, by which stage the respondent “had been drinking but was not intoxicated”.', 'The sentencing judge found that the respondent “gained entry either by jumping a queue or not paying or some similar event because they knew staff on the front door and had been there before”.', 'As a result, the respondent did not have a stamp on his hand which would permit re-entry if he left the club.', 'In fact he did leave the club about 30 minutes after arriving to get some food.', 'The respondent sought to leave by a rear door and asked the security guard to let him back in that way as he was only going to get some food.', 'The guard, Mr Ademi, refused to allow him re-entry by the exit door and told him he would have to re-enter through the front door.', 'Her Honour said that it was “not clear on the evidence” why Mr Ademi did this.', 'However, there was no finding that it was an unreasonable direction.', '9 The refusal aroused the respondent to annoyance and he called Mr Ademi an idiot.', 'Mr Ademi “then reacted by grabbing [the respondent] on the arm and pulling him away from the door”.', 'Her Honour found that there was a “physical altercation between the two of them” which was joined by other security guards from adjoining premises on Darlinghurst Road.', 'It would appear that the respondent was not an entirely passive party in the “altercation”, but her Honour made no finding as to why other security guards became involved and assaulted the respondent.', 'She accepted that he sustained facial injuries, including cuts, a bruise to his forehead and a broken nose.', 'Her Honour concluded, however:                                        “On the evidence before me, I accept that the only reason the victim and the other security officers acted in the way they did was because the prisoner himself had insulted the victim by calling him an idiot.”                              10 In several places in her judgment, her Honour commented on the culpability of the victim, Mr Ademi.', 'She described his conduct on this occasion as “an unprofessional over-reaction to a fairly mild insult”.', 'She also described his conduct as “provocation” and, without wishing “to be blaming Mr Ademi, the victim of this offence, for its commission”, treated his conduct as a circumstance of mitigation.', 'She further equated his conduct to throwing petrol “on the flames of an over-heated young male” and stated that Mr Ademi “acted in a physically violent way, entirely unnecessarily”.', '11 The respondent lived approximately 20 metres away in Earl Place.', 'After being beaten, her Honour said that he was “in a state of shock” and washed the blood from his face in the El Alamein Fountain and then went home.', 'He changed his clothes, took a knife from the kitchen, placed it in his jeans pocket and returned to the nightclub.', 'Her Honour stated:                                        “Why he went back at all, let alone armed with a knife, is not clear on the evidence.”                              12 Referring to the record of interview taken by police, she noted that the respondent appeared to have some difficulty in English but concluded that he “could not even explain his behaviour to himself at that stage”.', '13 One inference open on the evidence was that the real explanation was less than entirely exculpatory and that, when interviewed in the early afternoon of the same day, it was possible that he was conscious of that fact.', 'Nevertheless, her Honour rejected that available inference, stating:                                        “The Crown submits that, in finding the circumstances of aggravation, I would make a finding that [the respondent] went back to the nightclub armed, with revenge on his mind – and that was the reason he armed himself with a knife – in order to confront the victim and those who had attacked him.', 'To make such a finding would amount to a circumstance of aggravation, namely a premeditated planning of this offence.', 'As such, such a finding would need to be made beyond reasonable doubt.', 'I do not accept that this has been proved to that standard or at all.”                              14 Her Honour further stated that:                                        “I accept that in going back, armed, he acted without considered thought, more or less spontaneously, in a state of shock after being beaten by the victim and the other bouncers when he first left the club.', '… I do not accept that he went with the intention of confronting the victim, and take into account in making that finding that he did not immediately go back to the rear door of the premises where he knew the victim would be, but rather entered the nightclub through the front door.', 'He there met up with his friend Kevin Osifo who he had initially gone to the nightclub with.”                              15 Having found Mr Osifo, the respondent told him he had been assaulted by security guards and Mr Osifo noticed some injuries to his face.', 'Mr Osifo noticed that he was agitated and decided to take the respondent home.', 'He followed the respondent through the rear exit where the respondent again came into contact with Mr Ademi.', 'Mr Osifo did not catch up with him, however, until other security guards were approaching, following the attack on Mr Ademi.', 'Mr Osifo did not witness the attack which resulted in the charge.', '16 Mr Ademi’s statement was to the effect that he had sought to take the respondent from the club, whereas the respondent, in his statement to the police, suggested that he had found his friend, stayed in the club for a very short time, during which he invited his friend to go with him because “they smashed me”, then left with his friend following, saw Mr Ademi, called him something like “cunt, bastard” and, when he saw Mr Ademi’s angry face, pulled the knife out and stabbed him in the neck.', '17 Her Honour did not accept that the respondent left by the rear exit “merely in anticipation of meeting up with Mr Ademi”, but preferred the statement of Mr Osifo that it was his decision to take the respondent home.', 'However, she did accept that when he saw Mr Ademi he behaved “like a wounded hothead”, “went up to him and swore at him in retaliation for the beating he had suffered earlier”.', 'She accepted that the men started to wrestle, concluded that Mr Ademi “should have known how to quell the situation without yet another physical altercation” and found that the respondent did not have the knife in his hand at the time he swore at Mr Ademi.', 'Once the fight had started, her Honour accepted that the respondent “believed at that stage that he needed to defend himself” and that “in doing so at that stage he pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed Mr Ademi in the neck and head area twice or perhaps possibly three times”.', '18 The “facts for sentence” prepared by the police recounted the event as follows:                                        “Lombard led the way up the stairs to the rear exit on Darlinghurst Road.', 'This is where he had encountered the victim Ademi earlier.', 'The victim was still standing at the door working.', 'Lombard said ‘Look I am fucking did you cunt’.', 'The victim and Lombard began wrestling.', 'Lombard took the knife from his right pocket where he had concealed it and struck the victim twice to the back of the head and neck with the knife.', 'The victim suffered two puncture wounds, one to the scalp and the other more serious wound to the left side of his neck.', 'Ademi started throwing punches at Lombard on sighting the knife and being stabbed.”                              19 The statement recorded that in the course of the interview, the respondent had “indicated that he was angry about having his nose broken earlier and as a result getting blood on his watch and clothes” and that these “were the reasons he returned to the club with a knife and stabbed Ademi”.', '20 The trial judge made findings as to Mr Ademi’s injuries in the following terms:                                        “There is … no material before me … from which I could make any definitive finding one way or the other about the ongoing impact on the victim of these injuries, either physically or psychologically.', 'I do accept however that, fortunately for Mr Ademi, the injuries do not appear to have been significant.', 'There is nothing on the evidence before me from which I could make a finding that the severity of the injuries could amount to any circumstance of aggravation.”                              Discount for additional factors21 The respondent pleaded guilty to the charge in circumstances which permitted a discount on the otherwise appropriate sentence of 20%.', 'There was no challenge to that finding.', 'However, her Honour also found that there was “evidence of contrition and remorse over and above the entry of the plea of guilty”.', 'That conclusion was based on the fact that, in her Honour’s view, it was “far from certain that the Crown would have been able to prove the necessary element of intent” if a trial had been required.', 'So far as intent was concerned, her Honour expressed the view that it was “a relatively weak Crown case”.', 'It appears to have been on this basis that her Honour thought it appropriate to increase the discount because the plea evidenced something more than mere utilitarian value.', '22 The suggestion that there is necessarily error in identifying a proportionate discount for factors other than the utilitarian value of a plea is to adopt an overly mechanical rule.', 'In some circumstances, the provision of an arithmetical deduction may provide an element of transparency which promotes “accessible reasoning”: see Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ).', 'The real risks in arithmetical calculation are twofold: first, the calculation may lend an air of precision which, far from promoting transparency, may be misleading.', 'Secondly, to identify an arithmetical deduction in relation to a specified factor of mitigation, or more than one factor, may result in “double counting” if the factor is one which is “not susceptible to isolation from other relevant factors” or is not susceptible to “mathematical evaluation”: see R v MAK, 167 A Crim R 159 at [45].', 'It was the element of double counting, which led to an unduly lenient sentence and to the interference of the Court in that case.', 'Indeed, a specific discount for “remorse” was seen as inappropriate in circumstances where remorse was the underlying justification for treating other matters as mitigating factors: R v MAK at [42].', 'Thus, remorse would no doubt co-exist with the offender being a person of good character; would underlie a conclusion that the offender was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation, and is expressly identified as relevant to making reparation for an injury, loss or damage: see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 21A(3)(f), (g), (h) and (i).', '23 Taking into account, in a non-arithmetical way, each of the relevant mitigating factors identified in s 21A(3) will always run the risk of some degree of “double counting”.', 'As with allowance for factors of aggravation, care must always be taken to see that the end result does not appear overly lenient or harsh on what must be a largely impressionistic basis.', 'Once it was accepted as a fact that the plea justified a finding of remorse and contrition and that the finding was enhanced by the fact that it was a plea to a weak Crown case, a degree of alteration of a sentence otherwise appropriate would have been justified.', 'Accepting for the purpose of this contention the Crown’s complaint that the overall sentence was manifestly inadequate, it is nevertheless not clear either that there had been double counting or that the additional discount of 13.3% itself demonstrated error taking the sentence outside the appropriate range.', 'The specific complaint has not been made good.', 'Manifest inadequacy: a factual assessment24 The real question was whether the sentence, particularly when account is taken of the requirement that the non-parole period be served by way of periodic detention, in itself revealed manifest inadequacy.', 'The Director’s case was both that her Honour had “tailored the length of the sentence to enable her to order that it be served by way of periodic detention” and that, given the circumstances, a direction that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention demonstrated manifest inadequacy.', 'The sentence imposed (3 years imprisonment) was the maximum that would permit a direction that the non-parole period be served by way of periodic detention: see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 6.', '25 It is undoubtedly correct to say that it would have been inappropriate for her Honour to “tailor the sentence” in the way suggested.', 'But if a sentence of 3 years imprisonment with a 2 year non-parole period was manifestly inadequate, that being the maximum sentence to which an order for periodic detention could apply, then error would be demonstrated without the need to determine whether the inadequacy was due to inappropriate manipulation of the figures: cf Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26] (Howie J, Hodgson JA and Levine J agreeing).', 'There was no other basis for suggesting that the sentence had been inappropriately ‘tailored’.', 'Accordingly, the question remains the general one, namely whether the sentence was, in all the circumstances, manifestly inadequate.', '26 The Director acknowledged that an offence of this kind may cover a wide range of circumstances and that there were difficulties in relying on sentencing statistics, which themselves revealed the extent of the range.', 'Further, that range existed despite the fact that, as her Honour recognised, the offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and was subject to a standard non-parole period of 7 years.', 'There were significant reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the respondent having pleaded guilty and her Honour having made unchallenged findings that this was not a mid-range offence under s 33, but fell into the low range.', '27 The Director sought to obtain support for his contention from other cases in which similar sentences had been set aside.', 'Two, in particular, were referred to in the course of submissions.', 'The earlier, Regina v Dickinson [2004] NSWCCA 457, was a case involving an attack with a knife by the offender on a man who was apparently living with a young woman with whom the offender had had a prior relationship and with whom he had had a daughter.', 'The trial judge had imposed a sentence of 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months, and ordered that the sentence be suspended upon the respondent entering into a bond.', 'This Court upheld an appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence and imposed a period of imprisonment of 2 years 2 months, to be served by way of periodic detention.', '28 A second case, Regina v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216, involved an appeal by the Director in relation to an offence under s 33 in which the sentencing judge had imposed an identical sentence to that imposed in the present case, which had been held on appeal to be manifestly inadequate, although this Court had determined, in the exercise of its discretion, not to intervene.', '29 In describing these cases as ‘similar’, it is not intended to suggest that any dissection of the facts has been undertaken, in order to identify similarities and differences.', 'Thus, in Deng, after referring to Dickinson, James J (with whom Mason P and Hislop J agreed) stated at [80]:                                        “I accept that this Court should have some regard to the decision in           Dickinson          .', 'However,           Dickinson           remains a single decision on its own facts, some of which are dissimilar to the facts in the present appeal and this Court should not endeavour to determine the present appeal by attempting to make a point by point comparison of the present case with           Dickinson          .”                              30 The same cautionary note should operate in the present case.', '31 In the final analysis, an assessment of whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate must be made in the light of her Honour’s findings.', 'Some of those findings might well be described as generous to the respondent.', 'However, they have not been challenged by the Director.', 'There may be good reason for that.', 'For example, to challenge a failure to make an adverse finding would require the Director to demonstrate that her Honour was in error in entertaining a reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the proposed finding.', 'Further, her Honour’s conclusions depended upon more than findings of primary fact; they involved the drawing of inferences and the characterisation of degrees of culpability.', 'At that second level, a challenge by the Director would also run into obstacles.', 'As was explained by Spigelman CJ in Mulato v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37]:                                        “Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.', 'This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.', 'The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open ….”                              32 In the present case, that exercise was undertaken on the papers: no witness gave oral evidence before her Honour.', 'It may be appropriate in some cases to distinguish between the activities of primary fact-finding, inference drawing and characterisation of conduct.', 'However, that is not necessary in the present case, the Director having eschewed a challenge to any of these aspects of the sentencing process.', '33 Once it is accepted that the trial judge held that there was no premeditation or planning, that the removal of the knife from the kitchen was some form of spontaneous act without malicious intent, that the respondent did not seek out Mr Ademi for revenge, that on each occasion Mr Ademi reacted unprofessionally and provocatively with physical aggression in response to a verbal insult, that the respondent used the knife only after the commencement of physical violence and when in fear of further beatings, and that the injuries inflicted were not “significant”, it is not possible to say that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.', 'That it may well have been on a different view of the facts is beside the point.', 'Conclusion34 The ground of manifest inadequacy not having been made out, the Director’s appeal should be dismissed.', '35 BARR J: I agree with Basten JA.', '36 BUDDIN J: I agree with Basten JA.',

resumed online contact, including video calls on Skype.', 'They met in person at about the end June 2014 at a cinema in Chatswood.', 'The victim was accompanied by a school friend.', 'During the movie the appellant and the victim held hands, she placed her head on his shoulder and they hugged and kissed.', 'The appellant and the victim thereafter went out a number of times together.', 'On occasions

February 2016 and was cross-examined.', 'He was supported in Court by his mother, his aunt, his stepsister, his sister’s boyfriend and a long-standing friend.', 'The appellant’s case can be summarised as follows.', 'The appellant is presently 29 years of age and lives with his sister.', 'He is employed as a sound engineer.', 'He has a long history of stable employment.', 'The appellant subscribed to Zoosk looking for a serious relationship.', 'He had only been on two dates previously.', 'By the time the victim told him her real age he had already formed a strong bond with her and he had been lonely for so long that he could not bring himself to stay away from her.', 'He thought that they had both benefitted from the relationship because they had both suffered from depression at an earlier time.', 'After being charged he has spoken with family, friends and his therapist and now realises that the victim was not mature enough to have an intimate relationship with him.', 'He has not had any contact with the victim and does not intend to do so, whether there is an apprehended violence order in place or not.', 'After the offences but before he was charged he sought counselling to deal with his feelings.', 'He was given a Mental Health Care Plan by his general practitioner and undertook counselling with a psychologist.', 'He was prescribed antidepressants and initially his condition was unstable causing him to act impulsively, for example by punching walls.', 'He did not want to be dependent on the medication but he has subsequently settled on a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication.', 'During the course of treatment he was diagnosed as suffering from a borderline personality disorder.', 'He was told that this was likely to exaggerate his emotional response to any given situation.', 'He was an involuntary patient at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for 3 days in December 2014 after an episode of self harm.', 'He was admitted as an involuntary patient at Liverpool Hospital for 2 weeks in April 2015 after suffering suicidal ideations for 3 days.', 'He was admitted to Royal North Shore Hospital on 27 September 2015 for 5 weeks following a suicide attempt.', 'The appellant has investigated undergoing sex offender rehabilitation treatment in the community with his psychologist.', 'He is currently on waiting list to enter the program.', 'His acceptance to the program is dependent upon the outcome of these proceedings.', 'Dr Furst took a history that his parents separated when he was about 7 years of age.', 'He has one sister and three younger half sisters who he is close to.', 'The appellant had negative memories of his childhood and had increasing low self-esteem and depressive symptoms by his mid teens.', 'He continued to suffer from mood swings in his early 20s as well as having a poor self-image resulting in feelings of stress, agitation and frustration.', 'The appellant has had a number of episodes of deliberate self harm since November 2014 when the criminal investigation began.', 'He has had panic attacks up to several times a day since that time.', 'The appellant has been seeing a psychologist regularly from November 2014.', 'Dr Furst’s opinion is that the appellant has suffered chronic dysthymia (a low-grade long-standing depressive mood disorder).', 'He has subsequently developed an Adjustment Disorder with depressed and anxious mood as a result of being charged with the offences before the Court, although it could also be suggested that he has borderline personality traits.', 'Dr Furst did not believe there was any element of paraphilia in his psychological presentation.', 'Dr Furst is of the opinion that his chronic dysthymia and underlying personality disorder probably contributed to the poor judgement he displayed when engaging in a sexual relationship with the victim who was underage.', 'The appellant presents a high risk of self harm, including suicide, should he receive a custodial sentence.', 'Dr Furst was of the opinion that the appellant was a low risk of reoffending in a sexual or nonsexual violent manner.', 'I infer from his report that Dr Furst was of the opinion that the appellant would still benefit from a sex offender treatment program, irrespective of whether he received a custodial sentence.', 'Objective Seriousness of the Offence   \\t \\tThe courts have repeatedly emphasised the extremely serious view that has to be taken towards matters of this kind: R v JVP (NSWCCA unreported 6 November 1995).', 'The ages of victims and a range of criminality of the offenders may vary greatly, rendering a wide range of sentences appropriate.', 'The sentencing legislation does not permit the Court to deal with these offences by way of an Intensive Corrections Order or by ordering that any period of imprisonment be served by way of home detention.', 'The most significant matter which determines where a particular offence is to be placed in the spectrum is the degree to which the offender is seen to have exploited the youth of the victim: R v Sea (NSWCCA unreported 13 August 1990).', 'In this case, the appellant knew the victim’s age and actively sought to pursue an intimate relationship with her for a number of months that culminated in the commission of the offences.', 'There was an obvious power imbalance in the relationship.', 'The appellant was 28 years of age and there was a significant age gap.', 'There is nothing in the facts to support the conclusion that the appellant was a “sexual predator” or that he sought to persuade the victim by deception or\\xa0flattery.', 'The victim was vulnerable, by reason of her age and lack of maturity and that presented the appellant with the opportunity to commit the offences.', 'I do not accept the characterisation of the relationship by the appellant as a significant and/or mature, and in any event that would not be a mitigating factor.', 'Deterrence   \\t \\tThe abhorrence with which the community regards the sexual interference with children and the emphasis attached to general deterrence in sentencing offenders is reflected in the authorities: for example R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 at [20].', 'Custodial sentences in some cases of sexual assault on children are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young people from sexual interference by adults: R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445.', 'General deterrence may be attributed less weight in cases where the offender suffers from mental condition because such an offender is not an appropriate person to be made an example of: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [53]-[54].', 'The authorities do not mandate an entire disregard of general or specific deterrence by the sentencing judge.', 'The extent of the reduction depends on the circumstances of the case: Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [27], R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 and R v Lawrence [2005] NSWCCA 91.', 'The factors that are relevant to the assessment include the nature and extent of the mental condition suffered, whether the offender acted with knowledge of what they were doing and the gravity of their actions and whether the community require protection from the offender by reason of the mental condition suffered.', 'At the time that the offences were committed, the appellant’s mental condition was not as evident as it became in about November 2014 when the criminal investigation began.', 'At that time the appellant was acting with knowledge of what he was doing \\xa0and should have been well aware of the gravity of his actions, having a younger sister about the same age as victim.', 'I accept that as a person with a borderline personality disorder he may have found it more difficult to end the relationship but the causal connection between his mental condition and the offending conduct is weak.', 'No more than a small reduction in the weight to be afforded to general deterrence is appropriate.', 'There is some need for specific deterrence in this matter.', 'Whilst the appellant now recognises why his relationship with the victim was wrong, in his evidence he continued to seek to justify it by reference to his subjective circumstances, ie his lack of a serious relationship in the past.', 'Aggravating factors   \\t \\tThere are no relevant aggravating factors.', 'Mitigating factors   \\t \\tThe appellant does not have any prior convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'The appellant was a person of good character: section 21A (3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'The appellant tendered references from a number of people known to him.', 'Each of the referees attested to his good character.', 'He has always been gainfully employed.', 'The appellant is unlikely to re-offend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'This is the opinion of both Dr Furst and the Corrective Services psychologist, based on an actuarial assessment of risk factors.', 'The appellant has good prospects of rehabilitation: section 21A(2)(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'The appellant has referred himself for significant treatment since being charged with the offence and has been prepared to undergo a sex offender treatment program.', 'The appellant has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the appellant has demonstrated genuine contrition and remorse.', 'The appellant entered a plea of guilty at an early stage of the proceedings before the Local Court: sections 21A(2)(k) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'The appellant is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea.', 'The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide.', 'The primary consideration in determining where in the range particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32].', 'The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32].', 'I agree with the Chief Magistrate that the appropriate discount for the plea was 20%.', 'Consideration   \\t \\tI have considered section 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I am satisfied that having considered all possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.', 'The appellant was sentenced to a term of less than 2 years imprisonment by the Chief Magistrate.', 'There being no appeal against inadequacy by the Crown and in the absence of a Parker direction from me, he can be considered for a suspended sentence.', 'The factors to be taken into account in my view are as follows.', 'First, he will find custody more onerous than other people by reason of his mental condition.', 'It is likely that he will serve any custodial sentence on protection and under close supervision to avoid the risk of self harm.', 'Second, he has suffered significantly as a result of these proceedings.', 'He has suffered suicidal ideations and been admitted as an involuntary patient on 3 separate occasions since November 2014.', 'Third, he has been reporting daily since he was charged.', 'Fourth, he is employed and that is beneficial for the treatment of his mental condition and sex offender programs are available to him in the community.', 'The offences committed are objectively serious, there is a need for general deterrence, there is a need for denunciation of the offending conduct, and there is a need for retribution.', 'Whilst the subjective circumstances of the appellant are persuasive and almost compelling they are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the Court to ensure that a punishment of appropriate severity is delivered.', 'The penalty imposed by the Chief Magistrate being one of full-time imprisonment was appropriate.', 'If I had sentenced the appellant at first instance I would not have differentiated between the terms of imprisonment for each of the offences.', 'I would have started with a head sentence of 15 months for each offence, reduced to 12 months after the applicable discount.', 'I have not given a Parker direction to the appellant and I will not increase the head sentences imposed by the Chief Magistrate for counts 1 and 2, but will reduce the head sentence imposed for Count 3 to 12 months.', 'I have also come to a different view as to the application of the principle of totality, resulting in a reduction of the overall head sentence compared to that imposed by the Chief Magistrate.', 'I find that there are special circumstances because this will be the appellant’s first time in custody, the circumstances of his incarceration are likely to be onerous and he will benefit from a longer time on parole to allow for treatment of his mental condition and to participate in a sex offender’s rehabilitation program in the community, if necessary.', 'The Chief Magistrate was right to make the sentences partly cumulative and partly concurrent.', 'However, the sentences ultimately imposed did not reflect the express finding of special circumstances that was implicit in the sentences imposed for each count.', 'In order to avoid the same complexity, it is appropriate for the Court to impose an aggregate sentence pursuant to section 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.', 'The appropriate overall term of imprisonment is 2 years and 1 month.', 'That term of imprisonment will be discounted by 20% in recognition of the plea of guilty.', 'The sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed are: \\t    \\t \\tCount 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa08 months imprisonment.', 'Count

                  70066 of 2003         Regina v John Bodie Daniels                                Remarks on Sentence                     1 HIDDEN J: The offender, John Bodie Daniels, was tried for the murder of his partner, Janelle Tahuri, in the early hours of 31 October 2002 at the home unit in which they were living at Mortdale.', 'The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.', 'He stands for sentence on the basis that he killed Ms Tahuri by an unlawful and dangerous act, but without the intention to kill her or inflict grievous bodily harm upon her.', '2 The jury’s verdict amounts to a rejection of the offender’s account in evidence at the trial which, if accepted, would have meant that he was not criminally responsible for the death.', 'There was no eyewitness in the Crown case, although sounds of a commotion in the unit were heard by other residents in the block.', 'However, sufficient facts for the purpose of sentence can be inferred from the evidence.', '3 Ms Tahuri was killed after a violent episode in which the offender angrily remonstrated with her, believing her to have been unfaithful to him.', 'The incident lasted for some time, although for how long I cannot say.', 'It woke their two little children, who were in the unit at the time.', 'He mounted a sustained attack on her, as a result of which she suffered a serious brain injury from which she later died in hospital.', 'I can reach no firm conclusion about the exact nature of the violence which he inflicted upon her throughout the attack but, in the light of the evidence of neighbours and the medical evidence, I am satisfied that the brain injury was the result of his propelling her head against a wall.', '4 He had been drinking prior to the incident and I have no doubt that he was affected by liquor, although I cannot say to what extent.', 'At one stage he was heard to say, “Go in and show the fucking kids your face”.', 'It was the Crown case that, when he said that, Ms Tahuri’s face was bleeding from her injuries and he intended the children to see her in that condition.', 'In evidence, he denied that Ms Tahuri’s face was bleeding and, although he acknowledged having said those words, he explained them as no more than an emotionally charged utterance by which he meant that she should acknowledge her guilt to the children.', '5 However this dispute might be resolved, the fact that the offender sought to involve the children in this incident is a particularly unpleasant aspect of the case.', 'I do not find it necessary to resolve the dispute, although I can see the force of the Crown’s position.', 'On either view of it, the evidence shows the extent of his rage, which is also demonstrated by his uncooperative attitude to the police officers who arrived at the unit in response to a call from one of the neighbours.', '6 He was arrested that same morning and has been in custody since.', 'On legal advice, he declined to be interviewed.', '7 The offender was thirty-eight years old at the time of the offence and is now forty.', 'He was born and raised in New Zealand, and it was there that he commenced his relationship with Ms Tahuri and their two children were born.', 'The family came to Australia in 2001.', 'He has a criminal history in New Zealand through the 1990s, consisting mainly of offences of dishonesty, which is of little significance for present purposes.', 'His only convictions in New South Wales are for three summary offences, apparently arising out of the same incident, for which he was dealt with in a local court on 25 September 2002.', 'Their only significance is that for one of those offences he was placed on a twelve month bond, which was current at the time of the manslaughter.', '8 He had a disturbed upbringing, which it is unnecessary to recite.', 'It is sufficient to say that it provides the background to his leaving school at the end of second year of high school, his coming into conflict with the law, his heavy use of cannabis in earlier years and his heavy drinking throughout his adult life.', 'Nevertheless, it seems that he has a reasonable record of employment in unskilled positions, both in New Zealand and in this country.', 'He has always been close to his mother and his relationship with her current partner is satisfactory.', '9 I have a report of a psychologist, Mr John Machlin.', 'To Mr Machlin he described a relationship with Ms Tahuri which had not been without its difficulties, saying that there had been between them “probably some physical stuff but not violence”.', 'He did not elaborate upon this.', 'Their two children are now in the care of Ms Tahuri’s parents in New Zealand.', 'Mr Machlin reported that, while he maintained his account at the trial of the circumstances in which Ms Tahuri met her death, he mourns her passing and his loss is compounded by his separation from the children.', '10 Mr Machlin reported that he suffered “ongoing mental health problems” upon his admission into custody.', 'This was amplified in a report of another psychologist, Kirk Stenhouse, employed at the Kevin Waller Therapeutic Unit (KWTU) within the Long Bay Correctional Centre.', 'Early in 2003 he cut his wrists with a razor blade in what he said was an attempt to end his life, leading to his transfer to the Acute Crisis Management Unit (ACMU) at Long Bay.', '11 Mr Stenhouse reported that he provided “a long history of self-harm, with and without suicidal intent”, most of these instances having been “triggered by relationship conflict”.', 'He remained at the ACMU for six months, during which time there was another incident when he slashed his arm with a razor.', 'He was depressed and displayed psychotic symptoms, including paranoid thoughts.', 'He was considered by a treating psychiatrist, Dr Juratowitch, to be at risk of suicide, given his history and his psychotic symptoms, together with his perception that he had lost everything and his expressed belief that he would be re-united with Ms Tahuri in the afterlife.', '12 His symptoms improved with anti-psychotic medication, and towards the end of 2003 he was transferred to the KWTU.', 'There he underwent counselling and completed courses such as self-awareness, emotional regulation, relaxation and alcohol and drug issues.', 'By June 2004 Mr Stenhouse observed him to be “co-operative and compliant”, interacting well with other inmates and being “generally well regarded by staff”.', 'There had been no further incident of self harm but, given his history, Mr Stenhouse considered him still to be at risk of it.', 'The offender acknowledged that he still had thoughts of ending his life.', 'Generally, however, Mr Stenhouse saw him as “settled and focused on the future”.', '13 No doubt, the offender’s concern about the outcome of these proceedings contributed to his mental state.', 'Nevertheless, these incidents of self harm and psychotic symptoms convey to me that he has been tormented by his crime, even if he has little insight into his conduct.', 'Mr Machlin found his intelligence to be just below average, and his personality to be characterised by depression, a lack of self-esteem and a pre-occupation with securing affection, leading to “conflicting feelings such as rage, love and guilt towards others”.', 'Mr Stenhouse described his personality as “rigid”, and reported that he was assessed as “someone who would benefit from the KWTU program due to his paucity of skills for managing emotional difficulties”.', '14 While not excusing his behaviour on the morning in question, these observations go some way towards explaining it.', 'This, however, is not to deny the seriousness of his crime.', 'I received a victim impact statement from Ms Tahuri’s parents, which expresses in a moving way the lasting effect of her untimely death upon them and upon her two children.', 'To them I can do nor more than to convey my deepest sympathy.', 'However, I do not consider it appropriate to have regard to that victim impact statement in determining the appropriate sentence: s28(4)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.', 'Inevitably, a violent crime such as this devastates the victim’s loved ones, including his or her dependents, and my approach to the present case is in accordance with that of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 ACrim R 76.', 'In so saying I am mindful of the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [42]-[45].', 'It should be noted that the Crown prosecutor did not rely upon the parents’ statement to establish the aggravating factor set out in s21A(2)(g) of the Act.', '15 I have had regard generally to the aggravating and mitigating factors in s21A.', 'In particular, I note that no weapon was used: cf subs(2)(c), and that the offence was unplanned, being the result of a spontaneous outburst: subs(3)(b).', 'On the other hand, it was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty: subs(2)(j).', 'Indeed, he had been placed on a bond only a little over a month previously, albeit for an offence very much less serious than the present offence.', '16 He has not admitted responsibility for Ms Tahuri’s death in a manner consistent with the jury’s verdict and, in that sense, could not be said to be contrite.', 'His undoubted regret about the loss of his partner seems to stem to a significant extent from his feeling of isolation, including separation from his children.', 'Nevertheless, I accept that his psychological turmoil while in custody is also the product of a sense, at some level, of the enormity of his crime.', 'In short, while he may not have come to terms with what he has done, he has suffered for it.', '17 Clearly, he is in need of ongoing counselling, and upon his release he will need an extended period of supervision and guidance to settle back into the community.', 'With that assistance, I think that he has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.', 'I find special circumstances calling for a non-parole period less than the statutory proportion, although I am aware of the need for that period adequately to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence.', '18 I have been assisted by a schedule supplied by counsel of sentences in eight cases of manslaughter in a domestic setting, with a brief summary of the facts and salient subjective features of each offender.', 'It is not necessary to refer to them except to say that I was supplied with the remarks on sentence of Grove J in one of them, R v Nardoni [1999] NSWSC 1097.', 'Of that case I would observe only that, while it has some similarities to the present case, that offender pleaded guilty, was clearly contrite and was able to make out a stronger subjective case than the present offender.', 'Insofar as the cases might suggest a range, the sentence which I propose is towards the top of it.', '19 John Bodie Daniels, you are sentenced to imprisonment for eight years, to date from 31 October 2002, with a non-parole period of five years.', 'You will be eligible for release on parole on 30 October 2007.', '**********                                   Last Modified: 12/21/2004    \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t       \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tDISCLAIMER -

failing to pay contributions to the Central Provident Fund (`CPF`) for the month of January 1998 in respect of three of its employees within the period prescribed by reg 2(1) of the CPF Regulations 1987, namely, 14 days from 1 February 1998.\", 'The appellant was convicted as charged, and was fined $1,500 on each charge.', 'It was also ordered to pay arrears of $3,199 to the CPF Board and the costs of prosecution, which were fixed at $6,500.', 'I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against its conviction and sentence, and now give my reasons.', 'The background facts        The appellant is a company involved in the business of providing computer products.', 'It commenced operations in April 1997, when it took over the business of Arts Niche Cyber Distribution (`Arts Niche`), a sole proprietorship owned by one Kho Siaw Hwie (`Kho`).', 'Kho, who represented the appellant in this appeal, was at all material times in charge of the management of the company and was also responsible for paying the wages of its staff.', 'The other director of the company, Saw Chaik Lee, was merely a `sleeping` director.', 'The appellant first began to experience financial difficulties in July 1997 when a number of its business ventures fell through.', 'By September 1997, its prospects were, according to Kho, very bleak.', 'At the time of the trial, the company was still in existence, but had ceased operations and no longer had any employees working for it.', 'In the court below, it was not in dispute that the appellant had not paid any CPF contributions for the month of January 1998 in respect of Ong Bee Yan (`Ong`), Wan Wai Kay (`Wan`) and Aw Kok Chun (`Aw`), who were alleged to be its employees at the material time.', 'The only issue before the trial judge was whether Ong, Wan and Aw were in fact employees of the appellant in January 1998 within the meaning of the CPF Act for CPF contributions to be payable.', 'The prosecution`s case        The prosecution`s case, in essence, was that Ong, Wan and Aw were all employees of the appellant at the material time.', 'These three witnesses gave evidence to this effect at the trial.', 'Ong`s evidence Ong testified that she joined the appellant as an administrative assistant on 17 June 1997, with a starting salary of $1,680.', 'She was given two salary increments between July and October 1997, first to $1,800 and then to $2,000.', 'Her duties had included recording leave taken by the company`s staff and changes in the company`s stock.', 'She had also dealt with the issuing of pay cheques for staff salaries.', 'She had prepared these pay cheques on Kho`s instructions by filling in the names of the payees and the amounts payable on the cheques before letting Kho sign them; she had never filled in cheques pre-signed by Kho.', 'Ong told the court that she had been paid her salary regularly from June to October 1997.', 'Her pay cheque for November 1997, however, had been dishonoured.', 'During cross-examination, she denied that this cheque had been pre-signed by Kho and that she had filled it in and presented it for payment without his knowledge.', 'Ong stated that in December 1997 and January 1998, she likewise failed to receive her salary from the appellant despite having asked Kho for it on several occasions.', 'Eventually, she decided to leave the company.', 'She handed in her letter of resignation in January 1998, and her last day of work was on 21 February 1998.', 'She had not been dismissed by the appellant in November 1997; neither had she ever received a letter of termination from the company.', 'She also denied Kho`s allegations that she was guilty of `moonlighting` and misusing the appellant`s confidential information whilst in its employment.', 'Wan`s evidence Wan`s evidence was that he started working for Kho at Arts Niche in August 1995.', 'When the appellant was incorporated, he joined it as a systems specialist.', 'Although there was no written contract of employment between him and the company, he had been employed by the latter at the material time.', 'Wan testified that the appellant had not paid him any salary since November 1997 and had stopped paying contributions to his CPF account since September 1997.', 'He had received a pay cheque for November 1997 from Kho, but had been told not to present it for payment as the company had no funds to honour the cheque.', 'For December 1997 and January 1998, he had not received any pay cheques at all.', 'Although Kho had given him cash amounting to a few hundred dollars during those months, these sums were simply `something like pocket money`, and did not constitute payment for work which he had done for the appellant on its projects.', 'Wan also told the court that he had never been sacked by Kho or questioned about any impropriety or mismanagement on his part.', 'Although some of the appellant`s employees had been dismissed in the second half of 1997, he was not one of them and had never received a letter of termination from the company.', 'In fact, Kho had asked him to stay on with the company.', 'Furthermore, although some of the appellant`s stock had been found to be missing, this had nothing to do with him.', 'He had left the company`s employment only on 21 January 1998, approximately one month after he handed in his letter of resignation to Kho on 29 December 1997.', 'He gave as the reason for his resignation the appellant`s failure to pay his salary since November 1997.', 'Aw`s evidence Aw testified that he joined the appellant on 1 October 1997 as a systems engineer.', 'He had received his salary for October and November 1997, but had not been paid from December 1997 onwards.', 'The appellant had not paid the contributions to his CPF account for the months of October 1997 to February 1998 either.', 'Aw stated that in February 1998, he decided to resign from the appellant`s employment unless he was paid his arrears in salary.', 'He had never been dismissed by the company, whether in October 1997 or subsequently; neither had he received a letter from the company terminating his services.', 'He was also not guilty of any misconduct whilst he was employed by the appellant.', 'He had tendered his `Letter of Notification` to Kho on 24 February 1998, and his last day of work had been on 28 February 1998.', 'On that day, he had received a cheque for $500 from Kho in respect of work done on the `Orchidville` project.', 'He had signed a note acknowledging his receipt of this sum `in capacity of subcontractor [sic]` at Kho`s request.', 'Kho had informed him that the appellant could not pay him as an employee as it was being investigated by the CPF Board at that time, such that `all payments were to go to CPF first`; instead, it could only pay him as a sub-contractor.', 'The appellant`s defence        The appellant`s defence, in contrast, was that Ong, Wan and Aw were no longer its employees in January 1998.', 'At the trial, Kho gave evidence on the appellant`s behalf in support of this line of argument.', 'In respect of Ong and Wan, Kho testified that he had told them to leave the appellant`s employment in September 1997.', 'He gave two reasons for his doing so.', 'First, the company was in financial difficulties at that time and its future prospects were bleak.', 'Second, and more importantly, he suspected that Ong and Wan, amongst other staff, were guilty of misconduct.', 'Much of the evidence implicating them was said to have been recovered during a `lockout` carried out by the appellant in December 1997, during which its staff were kept out of their offices and its premises searched.', 'The allegations of misconduct against Ong and Wan covered four main areas.', 'First, Kho stated that he suspected Ong and Wan of being involved in `moonlighting` activities.', 'The basis of his suspicion in Ong`s case was her alleged poor performance at work.', 'Kho told the court that he was not satisfied with Ong`s supervision of Wan on matters relating to stock control.', 'He also considered that she had not kept proper records of the appellant`s stock, the leave taken by its staff, and the disbursements of petty cash.', 'In Wan`s case, Kho suspected him of `moonlighting` due to his failure to achieve the appellant`s target of making 15 sales calls per day, his failure to submit sales forecasts regularly, and the presence of numerous namecards in his office which were not reflected in his sales reports.', 'Second, Kho alleged that Wan had failed to bring to his attention the misuse of computer facilities by Andrea Gan, one of the appellant`s staff.', 'Andrea Gan had apparently installed unauthorised software into her computer at the office and used it for her own personal purposes.', 'Kho stated that this incident had taken place in December 1996, but Wan did not report it to him until March 1997, when he tendered a written `Statement of Investigation`.', 'Third, Kho asserted that Wan had failed to keep proper records of the appellant`s stock.', 'He highlighted in particular Wan`s failure to record the company`s T-loan of equipment worth $1,380 to Nanyang Polytechnic in the stock books.', 'Fourth, Kho told the court that Ong and Wan were suspected of collaborating in making unauthorised payments to students who were on part-time attachment with the appellant, contrary to the company`s policy.', 'Ong was also suspected of releasing cheques without his authorisation.', 'To substantiate his claim that such unauthorised payments had been made, Kho pointed to the fact that on 24 November 1997, a cheque for $5,000 drawn on the appellant`s account with Keppel Bank had bounced.', 'He explained that the appellant`s practice was to leave in its bank accounts only such funds as would be needed to cover cheques intended to be released.', 'The balance in the appellant`s Keppel Bank account in November 1997 before the cheque for $5,000 was presented for payment was $4,876.40.', 'According to Kho, if no unauthorised payments had been made, that cheque would have been cleared.', 'On this reasoning, the fact that the cheque was returned meant that a sum of some $123.60 had been released without his authorisation.', 'The pay cheques which Ong and Wan claimed they had been given for their November 1997 salary were said to be unauthorised cheques as well.', 'In support of this contention, Kho stated that Arthur Yao, one of the directors of the appellant`s sister company (`AM5`), had paid a sum of $10,000 into the appellant`s Keppel Bank account in December 1997 to cover pay cheques for AM5`s staff, as the practice was for both the appellant`s and AM5`s staff to be paid from that bank account.', 'The appellant thus had a balance of $10,895.47 in its Keppel Bank account after Arthur Yao had paid in the $10,000.', 'Kho claimed that there would not have been sufficient funds left in the account to cover Ong`s November salary after AM5`s staff had been paid, and thus, he could not have authorised the release of her pay cheque for that month.', 'The fact that Ong`s cheque subsequently bounced on 9 December 1997 was said to be proof that she had slipped in a cheque for her own salary without prior authorisation.', 'Kho alleged that the unauthorised cheques had been released as a result of Ong filling in cheques which he had pre-signed and issuing these cheques.', 'He relied on her records of cheques issued by the appellant, in which certain cheques were described as `blank`, to back up his assertion that she had received such pre-signed blank cheques.', 'Kho testified that when Ong and Wan were given notice in September 1997 to leave the appellant`s employment, both of them pleaded to be allowed to stay on.', 'He told them that if they stayed on with the appellant, it would be on a `by-project` basis, by which he meant that    somebody pays a company for a service or goods received, the company will split the gross profit among the staff in a consultative manner, meaning I will disclose to the staff the gross profit, and we would jointly decide how to split.', 'The company is not in the sharing, and merely welfare token.', '...', 'The ex-staff who took up this project ... are not doing this in the company`s premises, and they are not performing their duty as prescribed by the employment or service contract... [sic]       According to Kho, Ong and Wan agreed to work on a `by-project` basis after October 1997.', 'He conceded that no letters of termination were served on them, but explained that this was because he was concerned that their job prospects might be jeopardised if it was known that they had been served with written notices to quit.', 'He added that it was not his policy to issue his staff with letters of termination unless they were guilty of serious misconduct, such as stealing from the appellant or causing major injury to its reputation.', 'In the case of Wan, Kho also appeared to suggest that he had never been employed by the appellant at all as he had not signed a new service agreement when the company was incorporated in 1997.', 'Paradoxically, he went on to assert that    Wan was employed on a month-to-month basis with the company, because there wasn`t a contract between the company and Mr Wan.', '... Every month I pay the salary and CPF, there is no contract, therefore I can terminate anytime.', 'In respect of Aw, the appellant`s defence was that Aw had been recruited in August 1997 to replace Wan and had started work on 1 October 1997.', 'Owing to the appellant`s poor business at that time, Kho had informed Aw orally at the end of October that he would be transferred to AM5.', 'Aw had however indicated that he was `not aspired` [sic] for the type of work which he would have to do at AM5, and had agreed that November 1997 would be his last month in the appellant`s employment.', 'As in the case of Ong and Wan, Aw was not given any written notice of termination of his employment; neither was there a written record of Kho`s offer to transfer him to AM5.', 'According to Kho, Aw was no longer an employee of the appellant after November 1997.', 'Instead, he only worked for it on a `by-project` basis, such as assisting it with the `Orchidville` project at Suntec City.', 'The decision at first instance        The trial judge was not convinced by Kho`s allegations that the appellant had terminated the employment of Ong and Wan due to their misconduct.', 'In respect of Ong, the trial judge held that the mere fact that some of the cheques issued by the appellant had been recorded as `blank` cheques ([lowbar] 19, supra) did not point to the conclusion that these cheques were pre-signed blank cheques which had been given to Ong.', 'She suggested that the cheques could, for instance, have been unused cheques.', 'Since Ong had not been cross-examined on her records of the cheques issued by the appellant, the trial judge considered that no meaningful inferences could be drawn from this piece of evidence.', 'As for the fact that Ong`s pay cheque for November 1997 had bounced on 9 December 1997, the trial judge held that this did not constitute proof that the cheque had been released without Kho`s authorisation.', 'This was because it was not only Ong`s cheque which had bounced.', 'Four other pay cheques issued to AM5`s staff had also been returned on the same day.', 'The trial judge found that all of these cheques had bounced as they had been presented for payment on 8 December 1997 before Arthur Yao deposited the $10,000 into the appellant`s Keppel Bank account.', 'Besides, based on her calculations, the total amount of the cheques, including Ong`s cheque, came up to $10,620.90.', 'The trial judge pointed out that if the $10,000 had been deposited before the cheques were presented for payment, the balance in the account ($10,895.47) would have been sufficient to cover all the cheques.', 'She was thus not satisfied that Ong was guilty of wrongdoing, as a result of which her employment with the appellant had been terminated.', 'With regards to Kho`s allegations against Wan, the trial judge considered that they had been successfully rebutted by Wan`s evidence.', 'Wan testified that he had never been involved in `moonlighting` activities whilst he was employed by the appellant.', 'He had not been able to achieve the appellant`s target of 15 sales calls per day as he had to carry out both sales and technical duties and was thus unable to devote all this time to his sales work.', 'He admitted that he had not included all the sales calls which he made in his sales reports, but stated that this was because the reports did not reflect calls made to potential customers who had shown little or no interest in the appellant`s products.', 'Similarly, with regards to the namecards found in his office, Wan explained that not all of these names had been listed in his sales forecasts as he had either deleted them when they proved to be dead-ends or overwritten them when he generated new reports.', 'In respect of Andrea Gan`s misuse of computer facilities, Wan asserted that he had informed Kho orally of this incident in December 1996.', 'He had subsequently produced a written report on the incident in March 1997 at the latter`s request in light of a suit brought by Andrea Gan.', 'As for Wan`s alleged misappropriation of the appellant`s stock, the trial judge noted that Wan had denied his involvement in such misconduct.', 'She also found that Wan was a credible witness, notwithstanding the apparent inconsistency in his evidence as to whether he had ever received cheques pre-signed by Kho.', 'Wan initially testified that he had never been given any pre-signed cheques.', 'Instead, he had to fill in cheques in Kho`s presence, which the latter would then sign.', 'He later conceded, however, that he had on some occasions filled in pre-signed cheques, but pointed out that he had done so on the spot in Kho`s presence.', 'The trial judge held that there was no real discrepancy in Wan`s evidence on this issue as the cheques had been completed in Kho`s presence in both instances, regardless of whether Kho signed the cheques before or after Wan filled them in.', 'Wan had never received pre-signed cheques which he subsequently filled in without Kho`s knowledge.', 'She took the view that Wan appeared to honestly and genuinely believe, when he testified that he had filled in pre-signed cheques in front of Kho, that his evidence was not at odds with his earlier statement that he had never received pre-signed cheques.', 'She thus held that Wan`s credibility as a witness was not shaken by this apparent discrepancy in his evidence.', 'In the case of Aw, the trial judge likewise rejected the appellant`s defence that his employment with the company had been terminated in November 1997 after he declined a transfer to AM5 and that he had subsequently worked for it on a `by-project` basis.', 'She considered that the absence of a written notice of termination rendered Kho`s version of the material events unconvincing, and was not persuaded by his explanation that he had refrained from issuing Aw with a letter of termination in order to protect the latter`s future job prospects.', 'The trial judge also found the appellant`s defence on the whole to be either `inherently incredible` or inconsistent with its own version of the facts.', 'For instance, Kho`s evidence that he was dissatisfied with Ong`s performance at work sat uneasily with the fact that the appellant had given her two salary increments within only approximately four months of service.', 'Although Kho claimed that the company had increased Ong`s salary in order to `buy her loyalty`, the trial judge dismissed this explanation as a weak attempt to justify facts which were inconsistent with its defence.', 'Similarly, she found Kho`s allegations that Wan had been performing poorly at his work and was suspected of impropriety unconvincing, since the appellant had given him a bonus of $2,000 as recently as August 1997.', 'As for Kho`s contentions in respect of Aw, the trial judge rejected his assertion that Aw had agreed to work for the appellant on the `Orchidville` project on a `by-project` basis from December 1997.', 'This was because Kho had earlier indicated in his examination-in-chief that Aw was not keen to assist in this project as he felt that `fetching people to take pictures of orchids ... is not in the line with his career [sic]`.', 'Thus, the trial judge held that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant in January 1998.', 'Accordingly, she found the appellant guilty as charged.', 'The appeal               The appeal against conviction   The appellant`s appeal against its conviction was based, in essence, on the premise that the trial judge erred in her finding of fact that Ong, Wan and Aw were its employees in January 1998.', 'Although there were also numerous allegations directed at the trial judge`s assessment of the witnesses` credibility in the course of this appeal, I regarded these as part and parcel of the appellant`s challenge to her finding of fact.', 'Whether Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant at the material time It is trite law that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact unless they are plainly wrong (  Lim Ah Poh v PP     [1992] 1 SLR 713  ).', 'As I observed in  PP v Azman bin Abdullah     [1998] 2 SLR 704  :    [i]t is well-settled law that in any appeal against a finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses.', 'An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge`s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong ...       Where the trial judge`s findings of fact are based on his assessment of the witnesses` veracity and credibility, the appellate court will be even more reluctant to overturn his findings:  Yap Giau Beng Terence v PP     [1998] 3 SLR 656  .', 'Applying the above principles to this appeal, I was satisfied that the trial judge`s finding that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant at the material time within the meaning of the CPF Act was not plainly wrong, and should be upheld.', 'I reached this conclusion based on a consideration of the appellant`s arguments on appeal in respect of each of these three witnesses.', '(i) The position in respect of Ong The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in holding that Ong was still in its employment in January 1998 as she had committed wrongful acts which had led to her dismissal.', 'Ong`s misconduct was said to include, in particular, the unauthorised release of her cheque for her November 1997 salary.', 'The appellant pointed out that there were in fact six, and not five, pay cheques released in respect of that month`s wages, and that the total amount of these six cheques exceeded the balance in its Keppel Bank account at the relevant time.', 'It was thus argued that Ong`s cheque could not have been an authorised cheque.', 'The appellant also submitted that the trial judge erred in finding Ong to be a credible witness.', 'It reiterated its view that the reference in the company`s records to some of the cheques issued as `blank` cheques indicated that Ong did receive pre-signed cheques, and was therefore not telling the truth when she testified that she had never been given cheques pre-signed by Kho.', 'The appellant further alleged that there was a discrepancy between the evidence of Ong and that of Wan on the issue of pre-signed cheques.', 'Ong`s denial that she had received pre-signed cheques was said to be inconsistent with Wan`s admission that he had previously filled in such cheques, which discrepancy, it was contended, the trial judge overlooked in assessing Ong`s evidence.', 'I found no merit in the above arguments.', 'Admittedly, contrary to the trial judge`s observations, six pay cheques were released in respect of the wages for November 1997, and the total amount of these cheques ($11,737.50) did exceed the balance in the appellant`s Keppel Bank account after Arthur Yao had deposited the $10,000 into the account ($10,895.47).', 'This error on the trial judge`s part did not, however, detract from her finding that there was no proof that Ong`s pay cheque had been released without authorisation.', 'As the trial judge rightly pointed out, it was not Ong`s cheque alone which had bounced.', 'Four other cheques presented for payment on the same day as her cheque had also been returned ([para ] 24, supra).', 'In light of the appellant`s statement of account from Keppel Bank for the month of December 1997, the trial judge was right to conclude that these cheques had been returned because they had been presented for payment before the $10,000 was deposited into the bank account.', 'Indeed, Kho himself admitted in his examination-in-chief that this was the case.', 'Thus, contrary to the appellant`s reasoning, the fact that Ong`s pay cheque for November 1997 had bounced did not show that she was guilty of wrongdoing in the form of releasing her own pay cheque without authorisation.', 'The totality of the evidence in the present case also negated the appellant`s allegations of impropriety on Ong`s part.', 'The trial judge rightly observed that many of these allegations were incredible and inconsistent with the appellant`s own version of the material events.', 'For instance, if Ong had truly been suspected of misconduct, it was odd for her to have been given two salary increments within her first four months of service with the appellant ([para ] 27, supra) and at a time when, according to Kho`s evidence, she had already been given notice to leave the company.', 'It was also strange that Kho did not do anything when he discovered that Ong had released her November 1997 pay cheque.', 'If this cheque had genuinely been an unauthorised cheque, one would have expected Kho to either order Keppel Bank to stop payment of the cheque or make a police report.', 'Kho however failed to take any action until 17 March 1998, some three months after the cheque had been presented for payment, when he wrote to Keppel Bank asking it to stop payment of the cheque.', 'During cross-examination, Kho failed to give a satisfactory reason for his delay in writing to the bank.', 'His explanation that he did not lodge a police report as    I took a live and let live process ...', 'I am a kind person.', 'I am a Buddhist and I believe in pardon, generosity ...       was also unconvincing, and did not advance the appellant`s case that Ong was guilty of wrongdoing whilst in its employment.', 'As for the appellant`s contention that Ong was not a credible witness, this argument was a non-starter.', 'The trial judge was right in holding that a `blank` cheque is not the same as a pre-signed cheque ([para ] 24, supra).', 'The reference to `blank` cheques in the appellant`s records of cheques issued was not a sound basis for doubting Ong`s assertion that she had never received pre-signed cheques.', 'Furthermore, contrary to the appellant`s view, I did not find Wan`s evidence that he had previously filled in pre-signed cheques inconsistent with Ong`s evidence on this issue.', 'Wan only admitted that he had been given pre-signed cheques to complete in Kho`s presence; he did not state that Ong had been given such cheques as well.', 'Wan`s evidence on this point was therefore not at odds with Ong`s evidence.', 'Thus, given the lack of satisfactory proof of any wrongdoing on Ong`s part, coupled with her credibility as a witness, the trial judge did not err in finding that the former was not guilty of misconduct whilst she was in the appellant`s employment.', 'Furthermore, since no termination letter was ever issued to Ong and since the appellant failed to adduce evidence to show that she was working for it on a `by-project` basis after October 1997, the irresistible inference was that she had never been dismissed by the company, and was still its employee in January 1998.', 'The fact that the appellant conducted a lockout of its staff in December 1997 ([para ] 15, supra) did not go towards establishing that Ong was no longer employed by it by that time as the lockout could have been targeted at other staff who were suspected of wrongdoing.', 'For these reasons, I agreed with the trial judge`s finding that Ong was an employee of the appellant at the material time.', '(ii) The position in respect of Wan Where Wan was concerned, the appellant likewise contended that the trial judge erred in finding that he was its employee in January 1998.', 'The appellant`s case was that Wan had been guilty of wrongdoing, including failing to keep proper records of the company`s stock, which had resulted in his dismissal.', 'It was submitted that Wan`s account of the events leading up to his resignation from the company should not be believed as the latter was not a credible witness.', 'In particular, as in Ong`s case, the appellant alleged that there were discrepancies in Wan`s evidence on the issue of pre-signed cheques.', 'The appellant also reiterated its view that Wan had never been employed by it to start with as he had not signed a service agreement with it after its incorporation.', 'Taking each of the appellant`s contentions in turn, I was of the view that Wan`s failure to keep proper records of the company`s stock did not constitute satisfactory proof of the alleged wrongdoing on his part.', 'Although Wan had omitted to record the appellant`s T-loan of equipment to Nanyang Polytechnic in the company`s stock books, his mistake did not appear to be as serious as Kho made it out to be, not least because the loan was documented in other records from which the equipment in question could be traced.', 'It was therefore highly unlikely that this error on Wan`s part would have led to his dismissal by the appellant.', 'Moreover, as the trial judge rightly observed, the fact that the appellant paid Wan a bonus of $2,000 in August 1997 ([para ] 27, supra) was at odds with the allegations of misconduct made against him.', 'Equally, if there had truly been impropriety on Wan`s part, it was inconceivable that the appellant would have retained him to work for it on a `by-project` basis after October 1997 as Kho asserted.', 'I thus found the appellant`s assertion that Wan had been guilty of wrongdoing, as a result of which he was dismissed by the company in October 1997, untenable.', 'I also rejected the appellant`s argument that Wan was not a credible witness.', 'Although there was an apparent discrepancy in Wan`s evidence as to whether he had received pre-signed cheques, the trial judge had taken this factor into account in assessing his testimony and had concluded that this inconsistency did not affect his credibility as a witness ([para ] 25, supra).', 'Furthermore, in light of the line of questions put to Wan on the issue of pre-signed cheques during cross-examination, it was likely that he thought of `pre-signed cheques` as cheques which Kho had signed and which he had later filled in without Kho`s supervision or knowledge.', 'He might not have perceived of cheques which Kho had signed and which he had then completed under Kho`s directions as being `pre-signed cheques` as well.', 'On this view, Wan`s initial assertion that he had never received pre-signed cheques was not, in substance, at odds with his subsequent assertion that he had filled in such cheques in Kho`s presence.', 'There was therefore no basis for interfering with the trial judge`s decision that Wan was a witness of truth.', 'As for the lack of a written contract of employment between Wan and the appellant, this factor did not advance the appellant`s case that Wan was not its employee at the material time since an `employee` for the purposes of the CPF Act includes a person engaged under an oral contract (s 2 of the Act).', 'Besides, if Wan had never been employed by the appellant, it was odd for the latter to have issued him with a letter on 17 July 1997 confirming his status as its employee.', 'Admittedly, this letter was written to help Wan secure a housing loan.', 'Nonetheless, its very existence militated against the appellant`s contention that it had never employed Wan after its incorporation.', 'Accordingly, since the evidence adduced by the prosecution pointed to Wan being an employee of the appellant, which evidence the trial judge rightly found to be more credible than Kho`s evidence, and since there was no satisfactory proof of the alleged wrongdoing on Wan`s part which had led to his dismissal, the trial judge`s finding that Wan was still employed by the appellant in January 1998 was right on the facts of this case.', '(iii) The position in respect of Aw In respect of Aw, the appellant relied on his note dated 28 February 1998 acknowledging his receipt of the $500 for work done on the `Orchidville` project ([para ] 13, supra) as evidence that he was no longer in its employment in January 1998, since he was ostensibly being paid for his services as a sub-contractor, and not as an employee, at that time.', 'The appellant also contended that the `Letter of Notification` which Aw tendered to Kho on 24 February 1998 ([lowbar] 13, supra) was not a letter of resignation, but was simply a letter stating that the former would continue to work for the company if he received his arrears in wages for December 1997 and January 1998.', 'I rejected both of these arguments.', 'The note dated 28 February 1998 did not detract from the trial judge`s finding that Aw was employed by the appellant at the material time, as it related only to the payment which Aw had received in respect of the `Orchidville` project.', 'The note merely stated that Aw had worked on that project as a sub-contractor, and did not in any way suggest that Aw was not carrying on all other aspects of his work in his capacity as the appellant`s employee.', 'Besides, it appeared from Aw`s evidence that the note was drafted in the above manner as the appellant was being investigated by the CPF Board then and could not pay him as its employee ([para ] 13, supra).', 'On this view, the note did not establish that Aw was not the appellant`s employee at the material time.', 'As for the appellant`s contention with regards to Aw`s `Letter of Notification`, this was in fact counter-productive to its stance that Aw was no longer employed by it in January 1998.', 'I regarded the `Letter of Notification` as Aw`s letter of resignation.', 'This was because Aw had given evidence to this effect.', 'Moreover, he testified that he had drafted the letter in this manner to avoid the use of the term `resignation`, as he would have had to pay damages pursuant to his service agreement if he had resigned within the first 24 months of his employment.', 'On this interpretation of the `Letter of Notification`, the fact that Aw tendered his resignation letter only on 24 February 1998 would be a clear indication that he was still an employee of the appellant in January 1998.', 'Besides, even if, as the appellant asserted, the `Letter of Notification` was not a letter of resignation, it nonetheless pointed to the conclusion that Aw was still employed by the company at the material time given the express reference in it to his continuing to work for the latter.', '(iv) Counsel`s failure to put the appellant`s defence to the prosecution`s witnesses Apart from the above considerations which supported the trial judge`s finding of fact that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant in January 1998, the repeated failure of the appellant`s lawyers to put significant portions of the appellant`s case to the prosecution`s witnesses at the trial was a further factor which lent weight to her judgment due to the operation of the rule in  Browne v Dunn   [1893] 6 R 67 .', 'In   Browne v Dunn   (supra), Lord Herschell LC stated (at pp 70-71) that:    it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit.', '... it will not do to impeach the credibility of a witness upon a matter on which he has not had any opportunity of giving an explanation by reason of there having been no suggestion whatever in the course of the case that his story is not accepted.', 'To this principle, the House of Lords added two qualifications.', 'First, Lord Herschell indicated that there would be no need to raise such a matter in cross-examination where it is    perfectly clear that [the witness] has had full notice beforehand that there is an intention to impeach the credibility of the story which he is telling.', 'Second, Lord Morris suggested that cross-examination would be unnecessary where    a story told by a witness [is] of so incredible and romancing a character that the most effective cross-examination would be to ask him to leave the [witness] box.', 'The above principles, also referred to as the `rule in   Browne v Dunn  `, have since been formulated into the maxim that    [a]ny matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief` (  Cross & Tapper on Evidence  (8th Ed, 1995) at p 319;   Phipson on Evidence  (14th Ed, 1990) at para 12-13).', 'It must however be remembered that    [a]lthough the general proposition is that testimony not subjected to contradiction in cross-examination may be treated as unchallenged and thus accepted by the opposing party, the court is still entitled to reject such testimony ... A careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence must still be undertaken to determine the cogency and weight of such testimony.', '[  Liza bte Ismail v PP     [1997] 2 SLR 454  .]', 'Furthermore, counsel`s failure to cross-examine the opposing party`s witness may, in appropriate cases, be remedied by recalling that witness for questioning (  Reid v Kerr   [1974] 9 SASR 367 ), especially where such omission has been inadvertent (  R v Wilson   [1977] Crim LR 553 ).', 'In the present case, much of the appellant`s defence was not put to the prosecution`s witnesses during cross-examination.', 'For instance, Kho`s assertion that the pay cheques which Ong and Wan obtained for November 1997 were unauthorised cheques ([para ] 19, supra) was never put to either of these witnesses.', 'Aw was not asked about Kho`s purported offer to transfer him to AM5 in October 1997; neither was the appellant`s interpretation of his `Letter of Notification` put to him.', 'In their closing submissions at the trial, the appellant`s lawyers contended that whilst some aspects of the appellant`s case had not been expressly put to the prosecution`s witnesses, the questions which the latter had been asked during cross-examination had already laid the foundations for the defence`s line of argument.', 'In that sense, the rule in   Browne v Dunn   had been complied with.', 'Counsel further suggested that the omission to put the relevant matters to the prosecution`s witness could be rectified either by the prosecution recalling its witnesses for cross-examination or by the trial judge exercising her discretion to so order.', 'I was not persuaded by the above submissions.', 'Contrary to counsel`s contentions in the court below, the rule in   Browne v Dunn   was breached at the trial.', 'It could not be said that the evidence of the prosecution`s witnesses was `so incredible and romancing` (per Lord Morris) that cross-examination was unnecessary.', 'It was also not the case that the prosecution`s witnesses already had prior notice of the defence`s intention to impeach their testimonies (per Lord Herschell).', 'As Hunt J pointed out in   Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   44 ALR 607 at 630, it must be made clear to the witness whose evidence is to be impugned not only that his evidence is to be challenged, but also how it is to be challenged.', 'In the present case, Ong, Wan and Aw had no inkling of how their accounts of the material events were going to be disputed.', 'For instance, the appellant`s means of showing that Ong`s November 1997 pay cheque had been released without authorisation by relying on the fact that the cheque had bounced was never put to Ong during cross-examination.', 'In these circumstance, cross-examination of the prosecution`s witnesses could not be dispensed with.', 'Furthermore, the breach of the rule in   Brown v Dunn   in the court below could not have been remedied by recalling the prosecution`s witnesses for cross-examination.', 'Although the trial judge had the discretion to do so under s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`), this discretion is to be exercised sparingly (  Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor v PP     [1996] 3 SLR 276  ).', 'In the present case, counsel`s omission to put the appellant`s defence to the prosecution`s witnesses at the trial did not appear to have been inadvertent.', 'For instance, when counsel questioned Ong about the records which she had kept of cheques issued by the appellant, she could easily have asked her what the reference to `blank` cheques meant, in the process of which she could have put it to the latter that `blank` cheques referred to pre-signed cheques.', 'In light of the line of questioning which counsel pursued, her failure to raise this point did not seem to be an unintentional omission.', 'Besides, there were too many instances of counsel`s failure to put the appellant`s case to the prosecution`s witnesses for such omissions to be deemed inadvertent.', 'Given this fact, coupled with the self-contradictory and inherently incredible nature of the appellant`s defence (see, inter alia, [para ] 35, 41 and 45, supra), it would not have been appropriate for the trial judge to exercise her discretion to recall the prosecution`s witnesses for cross-examination had such an application been made before her.', 'Thus, in light of the breach of the rule in   Browne v Dunn   at the trial, the trial judge rightly accepted the prosecution`s case that Ong, Wan and Aw were employed by the appellant in January 1998 in lieu of the appellant`s defence that they had left its employment by the end of 1997.', 'This in turn provided an additional basis for upholding the appellant`s conviction.', 'Consequently, since the trial judge`s finding of fact that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the appellant at the material time was not plainly wrong and was well-supported by the evidence adduced in the court below, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction.', 'The appeal against sentence        Turning to the appellant`s appeal against the sentence imposed on it, it is well settled that an appellate court will not interfere with the sentence passed by a trial judge unless it is satisfied that the trial judge has made a wrong decision as to the proper factual basis for sentencing, has erred in appreciating the materials placed before him, has passed a sentence which is wrong in principle, or has imposed a sentence which is manifestly excessive (  Tan Koon Swan v PP     [1986] SLR 126     [1987] 2 MLJ 129  ).', 'In the present case, the trial judge did not err on the first three of these grounds.', 'The sole question to be decided was whether the sentence which she imposed was manifestly excessive.', 'Since the appellant had previously been convicted of the offence under s 58(b) of the CPF Act, under the second limb of s 61(1) of the Act, it could be sentenced to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for each of the charges brought against it.', 'The trial judge ordered the appellant to pay a fine of $1,500 for each charge as she considered the multiplicity of offences, the appellant`s reasons for non-payment and its defaulting on payment of CPF contributions twice within a short period of less than a year (from April 1997, when the company was incorporated, to February 1998) to be aggravating factors.', 'Given these aggravating factors, coupled with the fact that the fines imposed were well within the statutory maximum, I considered that these fines, although slightly on the high side, were not manifestly excessive.', 'I thus upheld the sentence passed by the trial judge.', 'I also upheld the trial judge`s order that the appellant should pay the costs of prosecution in the court below pursuant to s 401(1) of the CPC.', 'The court has a wide discretion to order costs under this section.', 'In exercising its discretion, the court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, including the strength of the prosecution`s case, the accused`s knowledge of this, and his conduct of his defence.', 'In particular, where the accused loses his case and the court is of the view that his defence has been conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily`, he may be ordered to pay some of the costs which he has caused the prosecution to incur (  Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew     [1993] 3 SLR 930   at 937).', 'One way of determining whether the accused`s defence has been conducted `extravagantly and unnecessarily` would be to consider whether the line of defence mounted has advanced his case:  Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh     [1999] 2 SLR 349  .', 'On this analysis, the appellant`s defence at the trial was extravagant and unnecessary since, being spurious in many aspects, it did not serve to advance the appellant`s case that Ong, Wan and Aw were no longer its employees in January 1998.', 'The trial judge`s order that the appellant should pay the costs of prosecution was thus justified.', 'I further ordered, pursuant to s 262(1) of the CPC, that Kho should pay the costs incurred by the Public Prosecutor in respect of this appeal.', 'Section 262(1) has been framed in very wide terms and leaves the question of costs and the manner in which costs should be assessed entirely to the High Court (  Wee Soon Kim Anthony v PP     [1993] 1 SLR 372  ).', 'In this context, the principles governing the court`s exercise of its discretion under s 401(1) of the CPC ([para ] 55, supra) are equally applicable.', 'It must be emphasised, however, that whilst the strength of the Public Prosecutor`s case against an appellant on appeal would be a relevant factor in deciding on an award of costs under s 262(1) by analogy with   Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew   (supra), just as    ... an accused person should not be made to bear the costs of prosecution simply because he chooses to claim trial even though the prosecution`s case is strong.', '[  Jasbir Kaur v Mukhtiar Singh , supra at [para ] 39.]', 'so an appellant should not be ordered to pay the costs of an appeal simply because his case on appeal is a weak one.', 'Instead, he should be ordered to pay such costs only if he conducts his appeal `extravagantly and unnecessarily` (  Oh Cheng Hai v Ong Yong Yew  , supra).', 'In the present case, the arguments which Kho relied on to challenge the trial judge`s decision were devoid of merit.', 'They consisted largely of unfounded attacks on the trial judge`s integrity and baseless allegations that the appellant had been denied a fair trial.', 'These arguments did not in any way advance the appellant`s case that the trial judge erred in finding that Ong, Wan and Aw were employees of the company at the material time.', 'Accordingly, I held that Kho had conducted this appeal `extravagantly and unnecessarily`.', 'In light of the arrogance and the disrespect for the

by a jury on 16 August 2006 of the offence of manslaughter of Hao Nam Tran, in the alternative to a charge of murder upon which indictment the prisoner had been tried commencing 7 August 2006.2 The circumstances giving rise to the death of Mr Tran were substantially not in dispute at trial.', 'On 13 August 2004, Mr Tran and his associates had gone to the prisoner’s home at Hinchinbrook and had made threats of violence towards the prisoner, who was not at home, and to the prisoner’s de facto wife in the presence of his children.3 Whilst the motive for this offence remained obscure, it appears that Mr Tran was under the impression that the prisoner owed him money, possibly arising out of a drug debt.', 'These events were reported to police and Mr Tran was subsequently charged with a home invasion offence.4 On the afternoon of 16 August 2004, the prisoner and several of his associates gathered at the home of a Mr Hanchard.', 'Included in the prisoner’s associates was one Khaled Hayek, an expert in martial arts, and known by the prisoner to be so qualified.', 'The prisoner’s de facto wife was also in attendance.', 'There was a discussion between Hayek and others concerning the threats made by Mr Tran towards the prisoner’s family.', 'The evidence of the prisoner’s de facto spouse suggested that at the time of this conversation the prisoner was otherwise engaged, playing with his children in the backyard of the premises.', 'In any event, it seems clear that Hayek indicated his intention to teach Mr Tran a lesson.', '5 The prisoner either independently or in association with the plan hatched by Hayek agreed to meet Mr Tran on the evening of 16 August 2004.', 'The prisoner told his de facto wife in the course of conversations which were the subject of listening device intercepts in the days and weeks following Mr Tran’s death, that he did not want to take Mr Tran to Hayek’s premises but that Hayek insisted.', 'The prisoner was at Hayek’s unit in Cabramatta at the time that Mr Tran was instructed to come, and the prisoner remained there after Mr Tran arrived.6 The forensic evidence, namely, a quantity of blood splatter on the curtains and walls of the living area, and on the wall and floor of the bathroom, together with the content of the prisoner’s subsequent conversations with his de facto spouse, establish that Mr Tran was assaulted within the unit principally by blows to the head, most likely inflicted by Hayek striking Mr Tran with his feet, then enclosed in shoes.', '7 The terms of the prisoner’s conversations with his de facto wife established the prisoner’s presence during the assault and the prisoner’s participation in an agreement with Hayek to exact some retribution for Mr Tran’s treatment of the prisoner’s family.', 'There was however no evidence capable of establishing that the prisoner himself participated in the assault.', 'When it became clear that Mr Tran had died from the injuries inflicted by Hayek, the prisoner assisted in disposing of the body by dumping it in Broad Street, Cabramatta, in the early hours of 17 August 2004.8 The jury’s verdict therefore accepted the proposition that the prisoner was a party to an agreement with Hayek to assault the deceased, and that the prisoner’s knowledge of Hayek’s qualifications in martial arts brought with it a realisation that Hayek would assault the deceased by way of unlawful and dangerous acts.9 The objective gravity of this offence must be measured principally in terms of the unlawful death of a human being which is, in any circumstances, regrettable and worthy of punishment.', 'Whatever the antecedents and reputation of the deceased, it must never be forgotten that the law places considerable value on the worth of a human life.', 'However the prisoner stands to be sentenced for his part in an agreement to inflict some harm upon Mr Tran, absent any evidence of actual blows inflicted by the prisoner.', '10 This aspect of the matter brings me to a consideration of the role played by Hayek in the deceased’s death.', 'It is a matter of some surprise and concern that Hayek was not charged in relation to the death of Mr Tran despite the identification of blood splatter on the shoes of Hayek.', 'It appears that Hayek seized the opportunity afforded by a police interview to substantially blame the prisoner for the deceased’s death.', 'As a result of the prisoner’s conviction and an extended interview with police in the expectation that the prisoner might provide the prosecuting authorities with some assistance, some consideration is presently being given to charging Hayek with an offence arising out of the death of Mr Tran, however I am informed that the Director does not regard the prisoner as a reliable witness given the lengths to which the prisoner went to distance himself from any role in the assault upon Mr Tran, and that it is unlikely that the prisoner will be of any assistance in any forthcoming prosecution of Hayek.11 The extent to which the prisoner should receive a discount on the sentence otherwise appropriate to the objective gravity of the offence on account of the information provided by the prisoner to police in the course of the extensive interview conducted on 15 November 2006, is the subject of some contention.', 'The prisoner’s senior counsel submitted that the issue of the prisoner’s reliability in any forthcoming prosecution of Hayek was a question for the jury.', '12 That is a self-evident proposition but one that is likely to remain theoretical in the light of the Director’s present refusal to call the prisoner to give evidence against Hayek.', 'However the Crown Prosecutor accepts that it is appropriate to nominate a discount on the basis that the prisoner will be identified within the prison system as an informer, thereby placing himself at personal risk and affecting his conditions of custody, see RNM v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 375.', '13 It should also be borne in mind that the legal representatives for the prisoner offered a plea to manslaughter on 23 June 2005 when the matter was still before the Local Court.', 'It was indicated at that stage that the prisoner would assist in the prosecution of other persons involved in the assault upon Mr Tran.', '14 The Director formed the view that the offer of a plea should be considered after the prisoner had provided an induced statement.', 'No such induced statement was provided.', 'In addition, the Crown indicated its willingness to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter shortly prior to trial, but that offer was ultimately rejected and the trial proceeded.15 I accept that the prisoner was willing to assist the authorities at various times, but that the prospect of retaliation towards himself and/or members of his immediate family dissuaded him from that course.', 'Having regard to the factors set out in s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I do not regard a discount of more than fifteen per cent as warranted in the circumstances of this case.16 The innocent complexion that the prisoner places upon his presence in the unit on the night of Mr Tran’s death is also consistent with the lack of remorse demonstrated by the prisoner in the course of his contact with Probation and Parole for the purposes of preparing the pre-sentence report that is now exhibit B on sentence.', 'The prisoner continues to deny the commission of any offence.17 I turn to the prisoner’s subjective circumstances.', 'The prisoner is the youngest of three children born in 1971.', 'In 1973, the prisoner’s mother was struck by a train and died.', 'The prisoner’s father remarried one year later to a woman who had two sons by a prior relationship.', 'The prisoner’s father and stepmother had a daughter.', 'When the prisoner was seven years of age, and there were six children in the family, the prisoner witnessed his stepmother’s death in a car crash.', 'The family then broke up, with two of the prisoner’s stepbrothers leaving to reside with their grandmother.18 Not surprisingly, the prisoner describes his childhood as unhappy.', 'The prisoner also alleges a period of ongoing sexual abuse as a child at the hands of a relative.19 The prisoner left home and commenced to frequent Kings Cross where he was introduced to heroin.', 'For approximately three years, the prisoner was predominantly homeless and part of the Kings Cross drug subculture until his first custodial sentence in 1992 for property offences and assault with intent to rob.', 'Prior to that time, the prisoner had received the benefit of probation and recognisances for a large number of property offences committed between 1988 and 1989.20 The prisoner has had two prior significant relationships, one between 1989 and 1991, resulting in the birth of a daughter who currently lives with her mother, and a further relationship between 1995 and 2000 resulting in the birth of another daughter.', 'The prisoner has the custody of that daughter, whose care has been undertaken by the prisoner’s present de facto spouse.', 'This third and continuing relationship has been on foot since 2000 and has resulted in the birth of a third daughter.', 'The prisoner’s de facto partner is supportive and looking forward to the prisoner’s release from custody.21 The prisoner left school at the age of fourteen years and began work in the construction industry, primarily as a cement renderer.', 'He claims that there have only been two years in which he has not been employed since 1994, other than periods of time spent in custody.', 'The prisoner has expressed an intention to seek a career outside the building industry upon his release.22 The prisoner’s history of heroin abuse commences at the age of sixteen years.', 'It is promising however that he has been on a methadone programme at various times, most notably between May 2000 and August 2004.', 'He claims to have abstained from heroin use for up to seven years but has relapsed on occasions.23 His criminal history is consistent with intermittent addiction, that is, primarily it consists of property offences.', 'The last custodial sentence was imposed in November 1999, resulting in the prisoner’s release in January 2000.', '24 I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded, although I was impressed by his de facto spouse, who is a highly intelligent woman seemingly devoted to the prisoner.', 'She is capable in my view of influencing the prisoner for the better.', '25 The prisoner has been in custody solely in relation to this offence since 3 September 2004.', 'Accordingly, the sentence will be imposed from that date.', 'I have determined that the prisoner’s need for further supervision in the community to assist him to avoid a relapse into drug abuse constitutes special circumstances.26 Taking all these matters into account, I regard a head sentence of eight years imprisonment appropriate to the prisoner’s objective and subjective criminality.', 'Applying a discount of fifteen per cent to that sentence I have determined to impose the following sentence.27 You are convicted.', 'I sentence you to a term of six years and ten months imprisonment commencing 3 September 2004 expiring 2 July 2011.', 'I fix a non-parole period of four years to date from 3 September 2004 expiring 2 September 2008, after which time you are eligible for release to parole.', '**********                                                                                   18/01/2007

accused a discharge amounting to an acquittal on the charge DAC 47244/05.', 'Facts 4.', 'Briefly, the accused had, over a six month period from October 2002 till April 2003, created a misleading appearance with respect to the price of the Autron shares being traded on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX).', 'He did this by placing orders at a price of at least 1 bid higher than the last traded price before the Pre-Close routine for SGX commenced.', 'In order to conceal his actions,   he had used his three trading accounts, one for himself and the accounts of Lim and Low to trade in Autron shares to support the share prices of Autron shares.', 'He had done so to prevent margin calls to himself as a substantial amount of his Autron shares had been pledged to financial institutions to obtain credit.', 'The accused had traded to maintain the price of Autron shares so as to prevent the financial institutions from demanding for margin calls should Autron share prices fall.', 'The accused’s trades in the said three accounts had therefore created a misleading appearance with respect to the price of Autron shares between October 2002 and April 2003.', '5.', 'By using the share trading accounts in another person’s names in broking firms to trade in Autron shares for his own benefit without duly informing the broking firm in writing or seeking its prior consent, the accused had therefore engaged in a practice which operated as a deceit upon the firms.', 'These offences occurred in the two periods from April 2002 to August 2002 and between October 2002 to April

2002, it incurred a net loss of A$17.2 million.', 'However, in FY2003, it made a profit of A$11.5m.', 'Relevant Trades 6.', 'Investigations revealed that between 1 April 2002 and 30 April 2003 (“Relevant Period”), Ng had used the securities trading accounts of himself, Lim and Low with Fraser Securities Pte Ltd, Kim Eng Securities Pte Ltd and OCBC Securities Pte Ltd to trade in Autron shares with the intention of maintaining its share price.', 'Ng was the one who had placed the orders for the Autron trades done in these trading accounts.', '7.', 'Ng was the beneficial owners for the trades conducted in the trading accounts of himself, Lim and Low.', 'Ng had paid for the losses incurred in these accounts.', 'Pre-close Routine 8.', 'According to SGX circulars, the pre-close routine is a period of 6 minutes starting from 1700hrs, consisting of a pre-close period and a non-cancel period.', '9.', 'At 1700hrs of each trading day, all unmatched orders are carried forward to the pre-close routine.', 'Orders can be entered, amended or cancelled during the pre-close period which runs from 1700 – 1705 hrs.', 'During the non-cancel period from 1705 – 1706 hrs, orders are matched and executed at a closing price computed for the day.', 'All unmatched orders will become void.', 'The computation of the closing price is based on a methodology described in SGX’s circulars, generally determined at the price with the largest tradable volume.', '10.', 'The purpose of the pre-close routine is to make it difficult for closing prices to be manipulated with a single transaction at an unusually high or low price before the trading for the day ends.', '11.', 'During the Relevant Period, Ng’s trades conducted in his, Lim’s and Low’s trading accounts had constituted 22% of the total trades of 874.9 million shares in Autron shares.', 'This was a large and significant percentage for a single person given that the Relevant Period spanned 13 months.', 'Ng was also a very active trader in Autron shares who traded on 260 days or 95% of the total 273 trading days in the Relevant Period.', '12.', 'On 32 days, Ng’s purchases in Autron shares had constituted more than 50% of that day’s traded volume.', 'On another 45 days, his purchases had represented between 30% and 50% of that day’s traded volume.', 'Thus, Ng was a significant buyer of Autron shares on at least 77 days.', '13.', 'On 205 days during the Relevant Period, Ng placed trading orders using his, Lim’s and/or Low’s trading accounts to buy Autron shares in the Pre-Close Routine.', 'The buy orders in the accounts of Ng, Lim and Low during the pre-close period are tabulated at  Annex A .', '14.', 'Ng was a significant buyer in the Pre-Close Routine accounting for 44.7% of all buying volume in the Pre-Close Routine during the Relevant Period.', '15.', 'On 131 out of these 205 days, Ng’s purchase orders during the Pre-Close Routine were entered at a price of at least 1 bid higher than the last traded price before the Pre-Close Routine commenced.', 'Thus, on these days, Ng’s trades had maintained the last traded price, or had put upward pressure on the closing price of Autron shares and

or any combination of the orders or transactions executed in the accounts of Ng, Lim and Low created or caused to create or was calculated to create, a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, Autron shares for the relevant period.', 'Offence 17.', 'Ng admitted that he had used his own trading accounts of himself, Lim and Low to trade in Autron shares to support Autron share prices.', 'He had done so to prevent margin calls to himself as most of his Autron shares had been pledged to financial institutions.', '18.', 'Investigations revealed that Ng had indeed pledged substantial Autron shares to financial institutions to obtain credit.', 'Ng had traded to maintain the price of Autron shares so as to prevent the financial institutions from demanding for margin calls should Autron share prices fall.', 'Facts in Relation to DAC 047239 of 2005 (2 nd  charge) 19.', 'Between October 2002 and April 2003, Ng had used his, Lim’s and Low’s trading accounts to trade in Autron shares in order to maintain the price of Autron shares.', '20.', 'As described above, Ng’s trades in the said accounts had therefore created a misleading appearance with respect to the price of Autron shares between October 2002 and April 2003.', '21.', 'Ng has thereby contravened Section 197(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289, 2002 Revised Edition)

Exhibit F. The antecedents to which he had admitted to were:         Date of conviction       Offence       Sentence imposed           5.8.2005       Section 6(a) Prevention of  Corruption Act (date of offence –  28 April 2003)       1 month imprisonment (concurrent)  and\\xa0 penalty of $250,000           \\xa0       Section 420 Penal Code   (date of offence – 3 Jan 2004)       2 months imprisonment           \\xa0       Section 6(a) PCA (date of offence  – 5 March 2004)   (3 charges under section 420  Penal Code and 3 charges under  section 6(a) PCA taken into  consideration.)', '1 month imprisonment  (consecutive)         Mitigation 8.', 'The accused is 53 years of age and is married with three children.', 'He had pleaded guilty to these charges.', 'Defence counsel informed the Court that the accused performed well during his national service.', 'He was the best recruit after his three months of basic military training.', 'He became an artillery officer and was later promoted to the rank of Captain during his reservist stint in 1983.', '9.', 'As for his educational and occupational background, counsel submitted that the accused had a first class honours degree in Civil Engineering and in 1982, he attained a Masters of Science degree (Construction Engineering) from the National University of Singapore.', 'According to the accused, he had worked for 4 years as a civil engineer in the then Public Works Department from 1982 to 1986.', 'Thereafter, he left for the private sector, working in a property firm, in a bank and a construction company.', 'Counsel tendered in copies of the accused’s professional credentials (which are attached at Appendix C to the written plea in mitigation) and a certificate of service and character from his previous employer, the Public Works Department.', 'The accused also claimed that he had been a financial donor to the National Council of Social Service, Independent Society of the Blind and New Direction.', '10.', 'With regard to the circumstances leading to the commission of the offences, the accused said he had initially made good profits in 1999 to 2001 arising from the appreciation of the shares he had purchased.', 'That was before the stock was listed on the SGX Mainboard in May 2001.', 'He had traded on the counter for Autron shares as he considered the fundamentals of the company as sound and had anticipated the huge potential for growth of the company in the China market.', 'After the stock was listed on SGX in May 2001, the accused transferred the shares he purchased into his CDP account in Singapore and into his various share margin-trading accounts.', 'He had by then acquired quite a large amount of the shares.', 'However, when the share prices started to fall by mid-July 2001, the accused’s margin accounts “started to tighten” and he started selling shares in his margin account and purchased more shares to leverage his position.', 'He was caught in a downward spiral and subsequently sustained substantial losses arising from the fall in share price from $0.34 to $0.18 after the “9-11 tragedy” in 2001.', 'The accused had hoped that by executing the trades in his account, that of his wife and Low’s, he could maintain the price of Autron shares and also increase his trading capacity.', 'He urged the Court to take into account that he remained fully liable for all the losses incurred in the accounts and had paid for these losses.', 'The trading houses had not incurred any losses.', 'He claimed that his remisier at OCBC was aware that he was trading on Low’s account.', 'In addition, he stated that the accounts in question in the proceeded charges were all trading accounts and not margin accounts.', 'The accused informed the Court of his current financial plight.', 'He claimed that he had spent about $3.9 million on Autron shares which are now worth only $71,000.', 'He indicated that he had outstanding bank overdrafts and mortgages and the present conviction had placed his employment at risk.', '11.', 'Counsel urged the Court to consider that the accused’s actions did not give rise to serious consequences and that he derived no benefit from his actions.', 'As for the offences of deceit perpetrated in connection with the purchase and sale of shares under sections 102 SIA and 201(b) SFA, counsel submitted that the deceit was by way of omission and was not so serious in nature as the accused was not an employee, dealer or remisier of the broking firm.', 'Counsel urged the Court to follow the cases of PP v Sia Teck Mong and PP v Foo Jong Kuan in sentencing.', 'Counsel went on to distinguish the case of Teo Kian Leong v PP on its facts.', '12.', 'Counsel also referred to the previous cases dealt with under section 97(1) SIA and section 197(1) SFA.', 'These unreported cases were  PP v Lim Ah Yeong Felix  (DAC 3757/2004, unreported, sentenced on 25/3/04),  PP v Wong Mei Leng  (DAC 29080/2003, sentenced on 3/02/04),  PP v Kwek Swee Heng  (DAC 28926/2003, sentenced on 4/06/04),  PP v Chong Thim Peng  (Links Island Holdings)(DAC 31437/2003, sentenced on 4/06/04),  PP v Ang Tian Kiat  (DAC 57285/2003, sentenced on 26/7/04) and  PP v Chee Ping Ewe  (DAC 21154/2004, sentenced on 28/06/04).', '13.', 'Counsel also mentioned eight previous cases involving offences of engaging in a practice which operated as a deceit.', 'Six of these cases resulted in the offenders receiving fines.', 'They are  PP v Lim Kim Hock  (DAC 6733/2005, sentenced on 25/2/2005),  PP v Ang Tian Kiat  (DAC 4937/2004, sentenced on 26/7/2004),  PP v Lee Yew Min  (DAC 61230/2003, sentenced on 25/03/04),  PP v Chow Foon Yuong  (DAC 49245/2003, sentenced on 11/02/04),  PP v Low Li Meng  (DAC 49242/ 2003, sentenced on 11/02/04) and  PP v Cheong Hock Lai  (DAC 49240/2003, sentenced on 11/2/04).', 'In the other 2 cases of  PP v Lim Kheng Guan  (DAC 15292/04, sentenced on 7/09/04) and  PP v Hoe Chin Hee Eric  (DAC 20527/2004, sentenced on 28/07/04), custodial sentences were imposed.', '14.', 'Counsel also urged the Court not to place any weight on the accused’s antecedents as the accused’s previous offences were committed after the present offences although he was sentenced earlier.', 'This did not show an element of deception on the part of the accused.', 'Counsel submitted that fines should only be imposed in this case.', 'DPP’s submissions 15.', 'The prosecution did not address on sentence but tendered in a list of sentencing precedents under s 97(1) SIA.', 'They were  PP v Foo Jong Kan & Foo Yung Kuan   [2005] SGDC 248 ,  PP v Sia Teck Mong & Gan Cheng Sie w  [2005] SGDC 249  and  PP v Leong Yew Cheong  (DAC 47220/2005, unreported).', 'With regard to the offences of engaging in a practice which acted as a deceit under section 102(b) SIA, the DPP highlighted the cases of  Teo Kian Leong v PP   [2002] 1 SLR 147  and  PP v Leong Yew Cheong  (DAC 42230/2005 & DAC 47235/2005, unreported) where the offenders received imprisonment terms.', 'Sentencing Considerations 16.', 'The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 197(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289) is imprisonment for a term of not exceeding seven years or a fine not exceeding $250,000 or both.', 'Similarly, each of the offences under section 201(b) SFA and section 102(b) of the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289) also carry the same prescribed maximum punishment of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine of $250,000 or both.', '17.', 'It is trite law that the first and foremost consideration in the balancing process in sentencing is the question of public interest: see  Sim Gek Yong v PP   [1995] 1 SLR 537 \\xa0 and  PP v Tan Fook Sum   [1992] 2 SLR 523  and  Ong Ah Tiong v PP   [2004] SGHC 11 .', 'This principle of advancing the public interest is sometimes stated as the deterrence principle and is often equated as the need for the protection of the public.', 'Market Rigging 18.', 'In dealing with market misconduct offences, such as market rigging and insider trading, public interest demands that the Court should adopt a robust approach to the protection of investors’ interest by imposing deterrent sentences.', 'This is because the primary objective of the law against such market misconduct is predominantly to ensure transparency and maintenance of a level playing market players: see  PP v Cheong Hock Lai   [2004] SGHC 122  at 41, 43 and 44 and  PP v Foo Yung Kuan & Anor   [2005] SGDC 248 .', 'This is evident in the Parliamentary debates on the amendments to securities fraud provisions in the Securities Industry Act (“SIA”), which provisions were re-enacted in the Securities and Futures Act (“SFA”) (see col 676, Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (17 January 2000)).', 'Both these aspects are thwarted by the deliberate creation of a misleading appearance of prices, not reflecting bona fide transactions for the sale and purchase of securities.', 'The punishment meted out by the Courts for such criminal behaviour must therefore not only adequately punish but also deter similar acts by like-minded persons who may be inclined to follow suit: see  PP v Cheong Hock Lai & Or .', 'Although a high fine can, in some cases, amply serve the twin aims of specific and general deterrence (see  PP v Cheong Hock Lai ), the type and severity of the sentence imposed depends on the specific criminal acts and relevant circumstances in each case, including the role of the accused person and the extent of fraud perpetrated.', 'Offences under Section 102 SIA 19.', 'Case law has also established that where an offender chose to trade unauthorized on an account belonging to a member of the investing public, this would evidence a higher degree of deceit so as to justify a custodial sentence: see  PP v Cheong Hock Lai   [2004] SGHC 122  at para 30, 38;  Syn Yong Sing David v PP  (Magistrate Appeal No.', '15 of 1998) (2 March 1999) (unreported),  PP v Lim Kheng Guan   [2004] SGDC 212  and  Teo   Kian Leong v PP   [2002] 1 SLR 147 .', 'The following passage from  PP v Cheng Hock Lai  is very pertinent and instructive.', 'The High Court said at pg 210: “I was firmly of the view that the important distinguishing factor in this case was not the\\xa0\\xa0 nature of the funds, but the fact that the respondents had traded on their own accounts at all material times.', 'It was beyond question that this evidenced a lower degree of deceit than if they had chosen to trade unauthorized on an account belonging to a member of the investing public.', 'Unauthorized trading on another person’s account was a common denominator in those cases of market misconduct in which a custodial sentence was imposed.', 'In my opinion, the district judge could not be faulted for referring to these cases.', 'On the contrary, it was eminently reasonable for him to do so in the absence of direct precedent.” 20.', 'Although counsel tendered in a number of sentencing precedents, it is not necessary to delve into all the cited precedents as the facts in some of them are not similar.', 'However, the Court finds three such cases particularly useful.', 'In  Teo Kian Leong v PP , the High Court upheld the global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment for the offender who had been convicted of 9 charges under section 102(b) SIA involving a total amount of loss of approximately $500,000 over a relatively short period from March to May 2000.', 'In that case, the offender had initially faced a total of 11 charges under s 102(b) SIA (Cap 289) for engaging in acts connected with the purchase and sale of securities, which operated as a deceit on another person.', 'These involved 11 client accounts.', 'On 1 November 2000, the prosecution proceeded on eight charges while the remaining three charges were stood down.', 'The appellant was convicted of all eight charges after a trial and was sentenced to serve six months’ imprisonment for each of the eight charges, with two sentences to run consecutively, making a total term of 12 months imprisonment.', 'The appellant’s conviction and sentence relating to the eight charges was subsequently affirmed by the High court on appeal.', 'As a result of the appellant’s representations to the Attorney General’s Chambers, the prosecution agreed to proceed on only one of the three remaining charges and applied for the two charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.', 'On 9 November 2001, the appellant pleaded guilty to the said charge and was sentenced to serve six months’ imprisonment which the trial judge ordered to commence at the expiration of his existing 12 months sentence bringing the cumulative term of imprisonment to 18 months.', 'The offender’s appeal against the cumulative sentence was dismissed by the High Court.', 'In arriving at its decision, the High Court discussed the cases of  PP v Hew Keong Chan  (DAC 21810-6/99) and  Syn Yong Sing David v PP  (MA 266/98/01) which involved a higher amount of loss but declined to follow the lower sentences imposed in those cases.', '21.', 'In a later case,  PP v Goh Bock Teck  (MA 296/2002), the offender pleaded guilty to two charges under section 102(b) Securities Industry Act.', 'He was a remisier with OUB Securities Pte Ltd and had used the Trading Error/Contract Amendment Forms of his stock broking firm to amend favourable trades into his own or his wife’s account, which would enable him to make a profit, whilst amending less profitable or unprofitable trades from his or his wife’s accounts to his clients’ accounts.', '38 similar charges were taken into consideration.', 'The total gains made by the offender and his wife as a result of all the 41 charges was a mere $4,551.60.', 'The mitigating factors included his clean record, the accused’s medical condition that he faced financial hardship at that time and has cooperated with the police.', 'The trial judge sentenced the offender to 3 weeks’ imprisonment on each charge, with both sentences running concurrently.', 'The prosecution appealed.', 'The High Court allowed the appeal and enhanced the sentence to 1 year imprisonment on each charge, with both sentences to run consecutively, making a total term of 2 years’ imprisonment.', '22.', 'In  PP v Leong Yew Cheong  (DAC 47229/05 & ors, sentenced on 15 Dec 2005), the offender, a former director and Vice-Chairman of Autron Corporation Ltd, pleaded guilty to 1 charge of false trading under section 97(1) read with section 104 SIA and two charges of engaging in a practice which operated as a deceit upon the broking firm under section 102(b) punishable under section 104(1)(a) SIA (Cap 289).', 'Upon his conviction, another 6 similar charges under section 102(b) SIA were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing.', 'He had a prior clean record and was not a remisier.', 'For the section 97(1) SIA charge, the offender had created a misleading appearance with respect to the price of Autron shares being traded on SGX by entering purchase order at a price of at least 1 bid higher than the last traded price before the Pre-close routine commenced.', 'This was done for 14 out of a total of 273 trading days between 17 May to 19 June 2002.', 'The offender managed to push the price of Autron shares by 1 bid or more for 7 trading days.', 'He did this by using the trading account of his personal assistant Tan Cheow Keon (“Tan”) and Tan’s husband Yew Boon Poh.', 'In order to prevent the financial institution from demanding for margin calls for the shares he had pledged should Autron share prices fall.', 'The offender paid for all the losses in these trading accounts.', 'He was sentenced to a fine of $180,000 in default 12 months’ imprisonment for the section 97(1) SIA offence.', 'For the two offences under section 102(b) SIA, he was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment per charge and the sentences were ordered to run consecutively, giving a total of 6 months’ imprisonment.', 'All of these three cases support the imposition of a custodial sentence where there was persistent unauthorised trading on another person’s account.', 'Where the losses incurred was paid by the accused or where the accused is not a remisier, a custodial sentence at the lower end of the spectrum might be appropriate.', '23.', 'Also, in determining the sentence to be imposed for an offence under section 102 SIA, the Courts should not be primarily guided by the loss caused.', 'The loss arising from the unauthorized trades is but one of the many factors that has to be taken into consideration.', 'The gravity of the offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed are also relevant factors: see  Teo Kian Leong v PP   [2002] 1 SLR 147 .', 'Thus, the relevant factors would include: (a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 the gravity of the offence (b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 circumstances under which the acts were committed (c)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 loss caused by the offender, if any (d)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 whether the acts were committed after deliberation and premeditation (e)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 whether the victims were vulnerable vis-à-vis the offender (f)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 whether there was an abuse of trust (g)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 whether the appellant pleaded guilty and/or (h)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 whether the appellant made restitution Reasons for sentence 24.', 'Each case must be decided on its own facts: see  Dinesh Bhatia Singh S/o Amarjeet Singh v PP   [2005] 3 SLR 1 ;  Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kutty v PP   [2002] SGHC 307 ;  Soong Hee Sin v PP   [2001] 2 SLR 253 ;  PP v Ng Tai Tee Janet   [2001] 1 SLR 343  and  Gan Hock Keong Winston v PP   [2002] 4 SLR 299 .', 'Assessment of Mitigating Factors 25.', 'I turn first to the various matters in mitigation raised by counsel.', 'The Court gave due weight to the fact that the accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.', 'The Court also gave weight to his cooperation with the police during investigation.', 'I also bore in mind that the present case was one where the documentary trail was clear given that the share transactions made by the accused would be documented by SGX.', 'Hence, the evidence obtained by the prosecution was quite strong and this would diminish the weight of the accused’s early plea of guilt: see  Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP   [1991] 1 MLJ 321 .', 'Notwithstanding this, I still place due weight to his plea of guilt as it was a clear indication of his remorse.', 'As for counsel’s argument that his incarceration would cause financial hardship to him and his family and might affect his current job, it is settled law that this factor has little mitigating value as no exceptional circumstances were brought to the attention of the Court: see  Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP   [1993] 3 SLR 305  and  PP v Tan Fook Sum   [1999] SLR 523.', '26.', 'Counsel also raised the argument that accused did not personally benefit from the commission of his crimes nor did he cause any loss and he had paid for the losses.', 'However, it is an established principle that the fact that the offender did not profit from his misdeeds or caused no financial loss to another is generally a weak mitigating factor.', 'This is because the principal aim of punishment is to deter a prohibited conduct: see  Rahman Pachan Pillai Prasana v PP   [2003] SGHC 52   Lai   Oei Mui Jenny v PP   [1993] 3 SLR 305 ,  PP v Gurmit Singh   [1999] 3 SLR 215 ,  Narindar Singh v PP   [1996] 3 SLR 639  and  PP v Ng Boon Teck  (DAC 29552 & Ors, 14 December 2005, unreported).', 'Thus, I gave due weight to these relevant mitigating factors.', 'I also took into account that there was no breach of trust involved since the accused was not a remisier or employee of the broking firm.', '27.', 'As for his record of antecedents, I did not place any weight on his previous convictions for corruption as they are not related to the present offences: see  Roslan Bin   Abdul Rahman v PP  [1999 ]  SGCA 10,  PP v Norhisham bin Mohamad Pahlan   [2003] SGCA 44 .', 'As for his cheating antecedents, they might, if he was convicted of these offences before he committed the present offences, be relevant in sentencing as both the cheating offences and the section 102(b) SIA offences involve the common element of deceit.', 'However, as the cheating antecedents relate to incidents that occurred well after the present offences, there was insufficient evidence before this Court to suggest that the accused had acted in defiant disregard of the law: see  PP v Boon Kiah Kin   [1993] 3 SLR 639  at 648.', 'Hence, his antecedents should have no bearing on the case before this Court and I regarded the accused as a first offender.', '28.', 'Although the accused informed the court that he made efforts in “social contributions” through financial donations to certain charitable organisations, counsel did not provide any further details.', 'While community service is a legitimate mitigating factor, I was of the view that the accused’s contributions in this case did not fall within the category of distinguished public service or services of substantial value to the community to warrant a substantial discount in sentencing: see  Lim Teck Chye v PP   [2004] 2 SLR 525 ,  Knight v PP   [1992] 1 SLR 720  and  Siah Ooi Choe v PP   [1988] 2 MLJ 342 .', 'Assessment of Aggravating Factors 29.', 'Before passing sentence, I made the following brief observation in open court: “The facts of this case are no less aggravating than those in the case of  PP v Leong Yew Cheong,  DAC 47229-37/2005, unreported.', 'This is despite the fact that the present accused is not a director or officer of the company concerned.', 'The accused’s criminal acts were deliberate and pre-meditated and were carried out on a systematic and very large scale.', 'The false trades were perpetrated over a prolonged period of time and it was done for his own benefit.', 'He had also made use of other persons’ account to camouflage his trades.', 'For the proceeded charge, the market rigging trades occurred on 126 trading days and he was able to successfully rig the trades on 111 occasions where the shares closed either at the last price at least 1 bid higher than the last traded price.” 30.', 'I had outlined some of the aggravating factors as noted above.', 'As pointed out earlier, the offences were carefully planned and pre-meditated.', 'Secondly, a high level of deceit was involved as the accused made use of other persons’ accounts to camouflage his trades in an attempt to push up the share prices of Autron shares.', '31.', 'Thirdly, the accused criminal acts were carried out on a systematic and large scale.', 'This applied to both the false trading and unauthorised transaction offences.', 'The false trades were perpetrated over a long period of time and it was done for his own benefit which was to prevent margin calls from the bank.', 'For the proceeded charges under section 102(b) SIA and section 201(b) SFA, the accused persisted with the unauthorised transactions for nearly 12 months from April 2002 to August 2002 and from October 2002 to April 2003.', 'In addition, the accused also admitted that, during the Relevant Period, which covered the charges taken into consideration, his trades conducted in his, Lim’s and Low’s trading accounts had constituted 22% of the total trades of 874.9 million shares in Autron shares.', 'This was a large and significant percentage for a single person given that the Relevant Period spanned 13 months (this is for both false trading charges).', 'The accused was also a very active trader in Autron shares who traded on 260 days or 95% of the total of 273 trading days in the Relevant Period.', 'On 32 days, his purchases in Autron shares had constituted more than 50% of that day’s traded volume.', 'On another 45 days, his purchases had represented between 30% and 50% of that day’s traded volume.', 'Thus, the accused was a significant buyer of Autron shares on at least 77 days.', 'On 205 days during the Relevant Period, the accused had placed trading orders using his, Lim’s and/or Low’s trading accounts to buy Autron shares in the pre-close Routine.', 'In addition, the accused was a significant buyer in the Pre-Close Routine accounting for 44.7% of all buying volume in the Pre-Close Routine during the Relevant Period.', 'In so far as the accused’s false trades were concerned, on 131 out of these 205 days, the accused’s purchase orders during the Pre-Close Routine were entered at a price of at least 1 bid higher than the last traded price before the Pre-Close Routine commenced.', 'According to the DPP, the accused’s false trades had affected the market as the share price had on 55 per cent of the 131 days involved closed 1 bid higher.', 'As the amount of false trading activities and unauthorised transactions made by the accused were persistent and more extensive than that in  PP v Leong Yew Cheong , the sentence should be higher to reflect a higher culpability on the part of the accused.', 'I also note that in this case there was no suspension of trading in the shares involved and therefore a custodial sentence was not warranted for the false trading charge.', '32.', 'I was mindful that there were a total of six similar charges that were taken into consideration and this would justify the imposition of a heavier sentence that would otherwise be imposed for the four offences that the Accused had pleaded guilty to: see  PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice   [1999] 1 SLR 138  at 142E.', 'Sentence imposed 33.', 'Having considered the seriousness of the offences, the need to protect the public interest, the circumstances of the case and the aggravating and mitigating factors, I was of the view that the maximum fine for the false trading charge was called for.', 'As the accused’s acts in conducting unauthorised trades on another person’s account were very extensive and

pleaded not guilty to a charge that as a person who had a health and safety duty under section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Matthew Johns (the deceased), an employee of the defendant, to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.', 'At about 2.30pm on 6 March 2013 at the defendant’s premises (the factory), the deceased was assisting another employee Mr Pham to lean a number of glass sheets stacked on an A-frame trolley forward to allow Mr Pham to remove one of the sheets stored behind them.', 'The glass sheets were 2306mm high by 2100mm wide and weighed approximately 80kg each.', 'The procedure adopted by the deceased and Mr Pham was for Mr Pham to lean the sheets towards the deceased and for the deceased to support them with his hands.', 'It was intended that when Mr Pham could access the required sheet, that he would attach a pinch grab to it and remove it to another A-frame trolley by the use of an overhead travelling crane (the crane).', 'The weight of the glass sheets became too much for the deceased to support and they fell causing him fatal head injuries.', 'At the time the deceased was under the influence of cannabis to the extent that in the opinion of Dr Judith Perl, a consultant pharmacologist, the deceased’s perceptions, judgement, decision making processes, vigilance, appreciation of dangers, concentration and reaction times were significantly impaired.', 'The issues to be determined are; \\t    \\t \\tDid the defendant fail to comply with its health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [6] of the Summons?', 'Did the defendant’s breach of duty expose the deceased to a risk of death or serious injury?', 'Preliminary point   \\t \\tAt the conclusion of final submissions, the prosecutor asked me to refer a number of questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to section 5AE Criminal Appeal Act 1912.', 'After hearing further argument on this point, the parties agreed: \\t    \\t \\ton the elements of the offence; \\t \\t \\tthat the proper formulation of some of the proposed questions of law depended on the factual findings that I would be required to make; and \\t \\t \\tthat it was appropriate for me to state the law in my judgment and to make the necessary findings of fact, on the basis that I would hand down judgment but not enter final orders until I had given the prosecutor the opportunity to renew its application, if it chose to do so.', 'The elements of the offence   \\t \\tThe

particularised   \\t \\tThe prosecution particularised the risk in [5] of the Summons as: \\t   The risk was the risk of glass sheets falling and crushing persons whilst those persons were attempting to remove one or more of the glass sheets stacked in an ‘A-frame’ trolley.', 'Inherent in the risk identified was that the glass sheets needed to be of a size and/or weight that were capable of causing a crush injury.', 'The evidence demonstrated that not every piece of glass handled or lifted in the factory presented the risk of a crush injury.', '[2]  \\t \\t \\tThe storage of glass sheets on their edges in A-frames presented an obvious risk of a crush injury if a worker was physically present in front of the glass sheets when they were being lifted or handled, ie in the fall zone.', 'It was necessary for the defendant to eliminate or, if that was not possible, minimise that risk by taking reasonably practical steps to prevent workers from being present in the fall zone while lifting or handling glass sheets, including during the loading or unloading of delivery vehicles.', 'Simply put, the workers needed to be instructed when lifting or handling glass sheets capable of causing a crush injury, not to stand in the fall zone.', 'These were the matters that had been identified by the prosecutor in the Glass and Glass Product Manufacturing Compliance Project undertaken by it in 2012 (the Glass Project).', 'The crush injury risk was particularly relevant to the defendant’s business because the defendant purchased and received from manufacturers and importers large glass sheets, that were cut down to various sizes at the factory to create end products including, window panes, glass doors, splashbacks and shower screens.', 'These risks were the subject of a visit by Inspector Stothard on 19 December 2012 as part of the Glass Project.', 'The prosecution opened its case with the contention that the way glass was moved in the factory was left to the discretion of individual workers based on their experience and that one of the methods adopted was to lean sheets of glass onto a worker in the manner involved in the incident.', 'The prosecution anticipated that the evidence of Mr Foye, Mr Heaton and Mr Spencer, former employees of the defendant would establish the use of that method.', 'The incident  Mr Pham’s evidence   \\t \\tMr Pham was the only witness to the incident.', 'He was a careful and thoughtful witness who appeared to be doing his best to tell the truth.', 'Some of his evidence was imprecise, but that was because English was not his first language and his difficulty with communication in English was apparent when he gave evidence.', 'By reason of both the content of his evidence and his demeanour I am satisfied that Mr Pham’s evidence should be accepted.', 'I am satisfied that the incident occurred as described by Mr Pham and his evidence can be summarised as follows.', 'On 6 March 2013, Mr Pham was employed by the defendant as a laminate cutter, with approximately 6-7 years’ experience in this role.', 'His normal hours of work were from 7am to 3.30pm, Monday to Friday.', 'Mr Pham had 20 years’ experience in the glass industry; having worked for Mant Glass and Graphic Glass prior to working for the defendant.', 'He had received on the job training as to how to safely handle glass in that period.', 'Mr Pham was cutting glass sheets for an order which was required to be loaded onto a truck that day for delivery to a customer the following morning (the order).', 'He had been asked by Mr Chamoun, the owner of the defendant, if he had started cutting the glass sheets required for the order that morning shortly after starting work.', 'At that time he told Mr Chamoun that he would start cutting the order shortly.', 'I infer that he had been working on cutting the glass sheets for the order, progressively throughout the day.', 'It was suggested by the prosecution that Mr Pham was under time pressure to complete the order so that it could be loaded onto the truck.', 'Mr Pham did not adopt that suggestion in the course of his evidence and I am not satisfied that there was any urgency required on the part of Mr Pham.', 'At about 2.30pm, in order to complete the order he required access to a glass sheet which was stacked on an A-Frame trolley behind other glass sheets, because the customer had revised the original dimensions required.', 'Mr Pham was in the process of using the crane, which was fitted with a pinch grab to move the glass sheets stacked in front of the required glass sheet onto a second A-frame trolley in order to allow him access to the required glass sheet that he needed to cut.', 'There were three overhead travelling cranes in the premises; two on the cutting side of the factory, where Mr Pham worked and one on the other side.', 'Each crane was fitted with a pinch grab.', 'On the day of the incident one of the pinch grabs was not working with the result that only one crane was available for use on the cutting side of the factory.', 'The deceased also worked on the cutting side of the factory as a float glass cutter, with his supervisor, Mr Mastroianni.', 'The deceased approached Mr Pham and asked to use the crane that Mr Pham was using.', 'Mr Pham told the deceased to wait for five minutes because he only had one more glass sheet to cut to complete his order.', 'The deceased said to Mr Pham, “No.', 'I need it” referring to the crane.', 'Mr Pham’s experience of the deceased was that “he was always in a rush”.', 'The deceased said to Mr Pham, “I will give you a hand”.', 'To which Mr Pham replied, “No”.', 'The deceased then said (in Mr Pham’s words), “I give you a hand to hold your glass for you”.', 'To which Mr Pham replied, “We need more people”.', 'The deceased then said, “No, no, no we can do it.', 'I’m okay I can do it”.', 'Mr Pham replied, “You need more people” and called out “Ralph”, trying to get the attention of his supervisor, Mr Mastroianni.', 'The deceased placed his right leg between the bars of the A-frame trolley [3]  so that his right foot was on the factory floor and held up one or two hands at about a 45 degree angle from his shoulders.', 'Mr Pham flipped over a glass sheet with his left hand away from the centre of the A-frame trolley leaving it to rest on the hands of the deceased.', 'Mr Pham also held out his right hand, in which he held the crane controller, so that the controller touched the glass panels in an effort to assist the deceased in supporting the glass.', 'From this description, I infer that Mr Pham was supporting a very small amount of the weight of the glass sheet.', 'After Mr Pham flipped the first glass sheet onto the deceased, he told the deceased, “We need more people”, to which the deceased replied “I’m okay”.', 'Mr Pham continued to call out “Ralph” on a number of occasions.', 'Mr Pham gave evidence that he did so because he knew that they needed more men, because the glass was too heavy.', 'Mr Pham then flipped the second glass sheet in the same manner and it was supported by the deceased and partially by Mr Pham with the crane controller in his right hand.', 'After the second glass sheet was flipped, Mr Pham continued to call out “Ralph”.', 'Mr Pham then flipped the third and fourth glass sheet towards the deceased in the same manner.', 'Mr Pham continued to call out to Ralph because he thought he needed help.', 'The deceased complained to Mr Pham that the glass was becoming too heavy and Mr Pham told him to run.', 'The deceased still had his foot through the bottom of the A-frame trolley.', 'The glass sheets that the deceased had been supporting fell onto him.', 'A number of employees, including Mr Mastroianni, came and assisted in removing glass from the deceased.', 'When Mr Pham was asked why he did not refuse the offer of assistance from the deceased, he said, “I’m not his supervisor, so I can’t stop him”.', 'Mr Pham gave evidence that prior to the date of the incident he had never moved glass by leaning it against another person who was standing in front of the glass, and had never seen other employees adopt such a practice.', 'If the glass was less than about 750mm high (a height Mr Pham described as “shorter than my belly”), glass could be flipped on an A-Frame trolley by two people with one person at either end of the glass panel.', 'Mr Pham had not tried to move glass previously by way of the procedure adopted on day of the incident was because it was unsafe and he usually worked alone.', 'Mr Pham gave evidence that the reasons he said “no” to the deceased on the day of the incident was because he knew the procedure being adopted was unsafe.', 'At the time of the incident Mr Pham described the deceased as impatient and he gave evidence that he had agreed to do what the deceased suggested, so as not to upset him.', 'Other evidence relating to the presentation of the deceased on the day of the incident   \\t \\tOn the morning of the incident the deceased assisted Mr Clarke, the production planner, to load a truck.', 'The deceased told Mr Clarke that he had a headache and that he intended to go out at lunchtime to buy some painkillers.', 'Mr Clarke gave evidence that the deceased seemed agitated at the time when they worked together.', 'On autopsy, a sample of the deceased’s femoral blood was collected and a quantitative toxicology analysis was performed.', 'Those test results were referred to Dr Perl, who was asked to provide an opinion to the prosecutor as to their significance.', 'On 23 September 2015 Dr Perl provided a report to the prosecutor [4]  that contained the following salient points: \\t    \\t \\tthe deceased’s femoral blood contained delta-9-tetrahyrdrocannibinol (THC) which is considered to be the major psychoactive drug in cannabis; \\t \\t \\tin 2013 there were no legal substances or medications containing THC available in Australia; \\t \\t \\tthe presence of THC indicated that the deceased had used cannabis, probably by smoking it; \\t \\t \\tthe concentration of the THC indicated that it was probable that the deceased had smoked the cannabis within one hour of his death; and \\t \\t \\tthe deceased’s cannabis use would have impaired his ability to safely undertake the task of moving glass sheets.', 'Dr Perl concluded her report with the observations set out in paragraph 3 above which I will not repeat.', 'Dr Perl was not required for cross-examination.', 'Did the defendant fail to comply with its health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [6] of the Summons?', '(Element 3)   \\t \\tThe prosecutor is required to demonstrate the particular measures that should have been taken to prevent the risk identified: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v Workcover Authority (NSW) (2010) 239 CLR 531 at [37].', 'In order to find the defendant guilty of the offence I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it failed to comply with its health and safety duty in that it failed to take the reasonably practicable steps set out in the particulars of breach in 6(a)-(e) of the Summons.', 'The alleged failures were not pleaded in the alternative.', 'What was alleged by the prosecution was that the defendant failed to ensure safety by not taking all of the steps referred to.', 'On that basis if the prosecution failed to prove that any one of the alleged failures was reasonably practicable, then the defendant was entitled to an acquittal.', 'This view of the pleading was raised after I invited the parties to make submissions on Bulga Underground.', 'In response the prosecution sought leave to amend the summons to plead that the defendant failed to take “one or more” of the relevant steps.', 'The defendant has not had the opportunity to make submissions on the amendment application.', 'My preliminary view is that the case was conducted on the basis that the proof of one of the failures was sufficient to ground a conviction.', 'However, it is inappropriate to decide the amendment application without hearing from the defendant.', 'It was common ground that the defendant had in place a system of work at the date of the incident.', 'It was not reduced to writing.', 'It was implemented through verbal direction and on the job training and enforced by supervision.', 'There were mechanical means available to workers for use in handling and lifting glass sheets, ie the crane.', 'The prosecution case is that the defendant’s system of work was inadequate in the respects particularised in [6] of the Summons.', 'In submissions, the prosecutor described the defendant’s system of work as “informal”, “ad hoc” and involving the exercise of a worker’s discretion, based on their experience, to determine how to move a piece of glass.', 'The prosecution submits that the particulars of breach set out in 6(a)-(d) were reasonably practicable because they were adopted in writing by the defendant in the Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) on 14 March 2013.', 'The adoption of a written SWMS seemed to be an integral part of the prosecution case, notwithstanding that such a measure was not specifically pleaded.', 'I will now turn to deal with each of the particulars of breach.', '6(a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ensuring the use of an overhead crane and pinch grab to lift, carry or move any glass sheets so heavy enough that they were likely to cause risk of injury.', '6(d)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Informing and training workers in the relevant prescribed size and thickness of those glass sheets which necessitate the use of an overhead crane and a pinch grab in order to safely lift, carry or move them.', 'These particulars can be conveniently dealt with together.', 'The deceased was employed on 8 November 2012.', 'He told Mr Dileo in his interview that he had worked at High Tech Aluminium (HTA) and had experience in the glass industry.', 'HTA was a local business operated by members of the deceased’s family.', 'It manufactured aluminium glass windows and doors.', 'It received pieces of glass cut to size for installation in window and door frames.', 'The deceased worked in the assembly of windows and doors.', 'Mr Dileo could not recall how long the deceased told him that he worked for HTA, but he believed the deceased undertook his apprenticeship with HTA.', 'The defendant held toolbox talks at which safety matters were discussed.', 'These were conducted by Mr Dileo, the factory manager, between July 2011 and December 2012 about once per fortnight.', 'Mr Dileo instructed the workers as to the approximate weights of glass sheets according to their size and thickness, that panels of up to 30kg could be lifted by one person or 60kg by two persons and that panels that were too large or heavy were not to be lifted manually.', 'Mr Spencer gave evidence that from his experience, a glass sheet that could be safely manually lifted by two people was no bigger than 2.4m long by 1.2m high.', 'His experience was consistent with his observations of the workers at the factory.', 'Cranes were used in the factory to lift large and/or heavy sheets of glass.', 'There were three cranes installed in the factory.', 'Mr Pham usually worked alone and would often refuse to move glass manually.', 'The defendant’s practice was to place new workers with more experienced workers to receive on the job training in the defendant’s system and to be shown how to perform tasks safely (the buddy system).', 'Inspector McDonald agreed that the buddy system was an accepted method of training and that persons could be considered “competent” within the meaning of clause 5 Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 (the Regulations) as a result of receiving on the job training.', 'Mr Chamoun told Inspector McDonald in an interview on the day of the incident that it was the usual practice of the defendant to use the buddy system to show new workers how to lift and manoeuvre glass.', 'Mr Dileo gave evidence that Mr Smith was allocated as the deceased’s buddy.', 'At the end of the evidence the prosecution tendered the personnel file of Mr Smith that demonstrated he was terminated on 9 November 2012, the day after the deceased was employed.', 'The contents of the file corroborate Mr Dileo’s recollection to the extent that the deceased and Mr Smith were working together on the day Mr Smith was terminated.', 'Mr Foot, the factory manager from January 2013 onwards, said that the training of new workers usually involved providing them with safety gear, a tour of the factory and then placing them with an experienced worker.', 'Mr Foot could not recall the identity of the deceased’s buddy.', 'In submissions the prosecution questioned the experience of the deceased at the time that he began working for the defendant and whether or not he had a buddy after 9 November 2012.', 'There were gaps in the evidence on these topics.', 'The prosecutor had the power to investigate these matters [5] , but did not do so.', 'The prosecution could have called evidence from the operators of HTA about his experience at the end of his employment with HTA, but did not do so.', 'I am not permitted to speculate about the evidence or draw inferences to fill in gaps in the prosecution case.', 'The lacuna in the evidence was insufficient for me to conclude that the defendant departed from its usual practice when it came to training the deceased.', 'I am satisfied that even if he was not present at the training provided by Mr Dileo that the deceased received training through the buddy system in how to determine if a glass sheet could be safely lifted or moved manually.', 'In any event from about February 2013, the deceased worked closely with Mr Mastroianni.', 'They both worked in the factory cutting float glass in a dedicated area.', 'Mr Mastrioanni had studied occupational health and safety modules at TAFE as part of his apprenticeship.', 'He was experienced in the glass industry and was employed as a supervisor at the time of the incident.', 'I infer that Mr Mastrioanni had considerable opportunity to supervise the deceased performing his everyday work.', 'The deceased was considered to be a safe worker based on the observations of him by the supervisors, Mr Dileo, Mr Foot and Mr Mastrioanni.', 'There was no evidence that before the incident workers were required to manually lift or handle glass sheets that were of such as size or weight that constituted a risk of injury, or in fact that they did so.', 'At the time of the incident, Mr Pham knew that the safe way to access the required glass sheet was to use the crane to transfer the obstructing glass sheets to another A-frame trolley.', 'He was involved in that process when approached by the deceased.', 'He knew that the way that the deceased approached the task was unsafe, because the glass was too heavy and the procedure involved the deceased standing in the fall zone.', 'He said no to the deceased on a number of occasions and he sought to dissuade the deceased from the procedure.', 'He called out to the supervisor on multiple occasions to get help and/or I infer to have the supervisor intervene.', 'Mr Pham’s participation was necessary for the incident to occur.', 'He failed to use the crane to lift and move the glass sheets that presented the risk of a crush injury, but he knew that the crane was required.', 'He had commenced the work with that state of mind and sought to convince the deceased to allow him to continue using the crane.', 'The prosecution relies on section 244(1) of the Act to argue that Mr Pham’s failure to use the crane was the conduct of the defendant, and that this conduct was thereby condoned by the defendant.', '[6]  Section 244(1) provides: \\t   For the purposes of this Act, any conduct engaged in or on behalf of a body corporate by an employee, agent or officer of the body corporate acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment, or within his or her actual or apparent authority, is conduct also engaged in by the body corporate.', 'Section 244(1) is a deeming provision that has the effect of facilitating proof of the responsibility of a corporation and it is designed to attribute conduct to the corporation for which it would not otherwise be responsible: Walplan Pty Ltd v Wallace (1985) 8 FCR 27 at 38 per Lockhart J.', 'In order to invoke the deeming provision the employee engaging in conduct must be acting within the actual or apparent scope of his or her employment.', 'It was common ground that Mr Pham was not a supervisor and had no responsibility for training other workers.', 'Accordingly, the prosecution cannot establish that it was within the apparent or actual scope of his employment to prohibit, warn, direct, train or supervise the defendant’s workers as contemplated by the particulars of breach in sub-paragraphs 6(b)-(e) of the Summons.', 'As to sub-paragraph 6(a) of the Summons, Mr Pham was not acting within the scope of his employment when he failed to use the crane because he knew what he was doing was unsafe and thereby he exposed the deceased to a very grave risk.', 'Mr Pham’s actions were not in accordance with his training and experience, they were inconsistent the duty imposed on him by section 28 of the Act and the express terms of his employment.', 'In February 2013, the defendant had its employees, including Mr Pham sign a document entitled “Wollongong Glass Policies – February 2013”.', 'That document provided at [14] under the heading “Occupational Health & Safety: \\t   It is the responsibility of each employee to;   \\t \\tTake reasonable care of the health and safety of others in the workplace; \\t \\t \\tCo-operate with the employer in their efforts to comply with OHS requirements such as following procedures and participating in hazard identification and reporting.', 'Use equipment properly in order to provide for the health and safety of other people in the workplace.', 'Serious breaches in the OHS procedures may result in instant dismissal.', 'The use of the crane by Mr Pham in order to provide for the health and safety of the deceased was at the time of the incident was an express term of Mr Pham’s employment and carried with it the threat of dismissal if it was not complied with.', 'For these reasons, I am satisfied that Mr Pham was not acting within the scope of his employment and accordingly the deeming provision does not operate.', 'The requirement to use equipment properly also applied to the deceased.', 'I am satisfied that the defendant’s system of work ensured by adequate training that was enforced by supervision, that the crane was used in the factory on pieces of glass that could not be manually lifted by two people, being panels weighing more than 60kg or bigger than 2.4m long by 1.2m high.', 'I am satisfied that the defendant’s system of work provided training to its workers on the weight of a glass sheet by reference to its dimensions.', 'It was not reasonably practicable for the defendant to provide the training required by sub-paragraphs 6(a) and 6(d) in a written SWMS for the following reasons.', 'First, a SWMS is only required by the regulations for “high risk construction work”, which the work in the factory was not: clause 299 of the Regulations.', 'Second, a person is competent within the meaning of clause 3 of the Regulations if they have acquired the knowledge and skills to carry out a task through training, qualification or experience.', 'Third, whilst a SWMS may provide evidence that a defendant has in place a safe work procedure, it does not necessarily follow that its workers have been adequately trained in the content of a SWMS or that they will comply with it.', 'Both Mr Pham and Mr Heaton were considered to be good workers.', 'Neither of them could read the SWMS that was adopted on 14 March 2013.', 'I have also found Mr Pham and the deceased failed to comply with the terms of the written policy contained in the February 2013 document relating to the use of the crane.', 'The deceased failed to comply with the terms of the written policy relating to drug use set out in [13] of the February 2013 document, by being in the factory whilst under the influence of cannabis.', 'Finally, for the reasons expressed the defendant trained the workers by oral instruction and on the job training in the matters required by the particulars of breach in 6(a) and 6(d) and those matters were enforced by adequate supervision.', '6(b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Prohibiting workers from attempting to support by hand multiple glass sheets in order to extract a sheet of glass from behind those sheets stacked in an ‘A-frame’ trolley.', '6(c)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Warning and directing workers against standing in front of multiple glass sheets while those glass sheets are being removed from an ‘A-frame’ trolley   \\t \\tIt is convenient to deal with these particulars together.', 'Sub-paragraph 6(b) was derived from the mechanism of the incident.', 'Such a prohibition would only have prevented the risk of a crush injury if it also included a prohibition on standing in the fall zone.', 'Sub-paragraph 6(c) required the workers to be trained not to access the fall zone while lifting or handling glass sheets of a sufficient size or weight to constitute a risk of crush injury.', 'On 19 December 2012 Inspector Stothard made contemporaneous notes that he was told by Mr Chamoun during his Glass Project compliance visit to the factory that the workers were instructed not to stand in the fall zone when unloading timber crates and loading or unloading delivery vehicles.', '[7]  \\t \\t \\tMr Pham knew that it was unsafe for the deceased to stand in the fall zone at the time of the incident.', 'Mr Dileo considered that standing in the fall zone of a glass panel taller than 650mm high was unsafe and he would have intervened if he saw that happen.', 'Mr Foot observed that if two people were moving a glass panel they would stand at each end of it and not in front of it, ie in the fall zone.', 'Mr Mastrioanni described leaning glass sheets against a worker as “too dangerous” and that he knew not to stand in the fall zone, presumably from his training and experience.', 'Mr Spencer gave evidence that it was dangerous for workers to be present in the fall zone and that he had not seen workers at the factory do so when handling or lifting glass sheets of a size that could be lifted by two people which he described as no bigger than 2.4m long and 1.2m high.', 'None of the witness called had ever seen a worker at the factory attempt to do what the deceased did at the time of the incident, ie to support multiple glass sheets by hand whilst standing in the fall zone.', 'Each of the supervisors gave evidence that they would have intervened to stop such conduct because it was unsafe.', 'The evidence of all of the witnesses, except Mr Heaton, was that workers did not stand in the fall zone when involved in the process of leaning out large and/or heavy glass sheets on an A-frame trolley to gain access to sheets behind them.', 'In other words, only the evidence of Mr Heaton supported the prosecution’s contention made in opening the case that one of the methods adopted in the manual handling of glass in the factory was to lean large and/or heavy glass sheets onto a worker as occurred in the incident.', 'Mr Heaton’s evidence was that glass sheets up to 920mm high were often leaned against the hips or shoulders of workers standing in the fall zone.', 'He said that he would have considered it unsafe to adopt the procedure with a glass sheet that was higher than his shoulder when sitting on the base of an A-frame trolley.', 'I do not accept Mr Heaton’s evidence for the following reasons.', 'First, Mr Heaton could not provide the names of the other workers that assisted him in this task and it could not therefore be tested.', 'Second, Mr Heaton had preconceived opinions to the effect that the procedures in place at the defendant were not safe.', 'Mr Heaton did not provide any basis for that opinion.', 'Third, Mr Heaton had discussed his views with many of his co-workers particularly after the incident.', 'Mr Heaton was called as a witness at the suggestion of Mr Foye, another ex-employee of the defendant.', 'Mr Heaton and Mr Foye discussed the case within a very short time of them both giving evidence.', 'His evidence about the content of those discussions was so vague as to lead me to the conclusion that he was not trying to assist the Court.', 'Fourth, Mr Heaton was terminated by the defendant for failing to attend work for an extended period.', 'He described his termination as “the happiest day of my life”.', 'Overall, there was a significant risk that Mr Heaton’s evidence was contaminated by his discussions with Mr Foye and/or was otherwise unreliable by reason of his unexplained attitude towards the defendant.', 'I am satisfied on the evidence that workers did not stand in the fall zone when lifting or handling large and/or heavy glass sheets because they were instructed not to.', 'It was not reasonably practicable to prohibit the workers from attempting to support multiple glass sheets by hand, because it was not a practice adopted in the factory, it was contrary to the instructions given to the workers by the defendant and thereby it was not reasonably foreseeable.', 'The precise mechanism of the incident occurred by reason of the deceased acting irrationally and by both the deceased and Mr Pham acting against instructions and with a significant disregard for safety.', 'That set of circumstances was also not reasonably foreseeable.', 'It was not reasonably practicable for the defendant to provide the training required by sub-paragraphs 6(c) in a written SWMS for the reasons expressed in [92]-[94] above and by reason of the fact that the defendant trained the workers by oral instruction and on the job training in the matters required by the particulars of breach in 6(c).', '6(e)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Providing a system of supervision in which the removal of the said glass sheets from an ‘A-frame’ trolley is under the direct control and instruction of a leading hand or supervisor.', 'At the time of the incident, Mr Foot was in the lunch room and Mr Mastrioanni was in the office of the factory attending to paperwork.', 'There was no evidence as to how long they had been away from the factory floor or how often that usually occurred.', 'The prosecution’s ultimate submission was there was no system in place by which the removal of the glass sheets from the A-frame trolley was under the instruction of a supervisor.', 'In my view, the action required of the defendant by sub-paragraph (e) is unclear.', 'It would seem to require that a supervisor or leading hand be present or be close enough to provide “instruction” during the unloading of every A-frame trolley at the factory.', 'There was very little, if any, evidence led by the prosecution on this point.', 'There was no evidence as to how often an A-frame trolley was unloaded at the factory.', 'The evidence was clear that Mr Pham did not require supervision to unload an A-frame trolley.', 'Immediately before the incident he was completing that work safely with the use of the crane.', 'Mr Mastrioanni gave evidence that the deceased could do certain tasks unsupervised.', 'Those tasks were not identified in the evidence.', 'There was no evidence as to what the deceased was doing immediately before the incident or whether he required supervision to complete that task.', 'The evidence did not identify the facts that I would need to consider to determine if the supervision of the unloading of every A-frame trolley at the factory was reasonably practicable.', 'It follows that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was.', 'Conclusion as to Element 3   \\t \\tI have decided that the prosecution have failed to prove that any of the failures pleaded were reasonably practicable.', 'It follows that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prosecution has proved that all of the alleged failures were reasonably practicable.', 'For these reasons I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant breached its health and safety duty by failing to take the steps particularised in [6] of the Summons.', 'Did the defendant’s breach of duty expose the deceased to a risk of death or serious injury?', '(Element 4)   \\t \\tThe deceased was exposed to a risk of crush injury when handling or moving large and or heavy glass sheets in the factory.', 'That risk was a risk of death or serious injury.', 'For the reasons I have given I am satisfied that the defendant took appropriate steps to eliminate or minimise that risk by training the deceased: \\t    \\t \\tnot to try to manually handle glass sheets that were too large or heavy; and \\t \\t \\tto remain clear of the fall zone.', 'Regrettably, the deceased did not adhere to that training on the day of the incident and behaved in a way that was out of character.', 'He did not listen to Mr Pham, a more experienced worker.', 'The time saving that would have been achieved if he was successful in the procedure adopted would have been minimal.', 'I find that he behaved irrationally and without any regard for his own safety because he was under the influence of cannabis.', 'By reason of my finding on element 3, that there was no breach of the health and safety duty owed by the defendant, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of element 4.', 'Conclusion   \\t \\tThe prosecution has not proved all of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.', 'I will not enter final orders until the prosecution has had an opportunity to consider the application pursuant to section 5AE Criminal Appeal Act 1912.', 'I will fix a date for further argument.', 'On that date I will deal with the amendment application referred to in [60] above, the section 5AE application if pressed and any application for costs.', 'Orders   \\t \\tSince delivering reasons on 31 March 2016 I have been advised that the prosecution does not wish to make an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal and that the parties have not asked me to resolve the amendment application.', 'I find the defendant not guilty.', 'The Summons is dismissed.', 'The parties have agreed that the prosecution is to pay the defendant’s costs as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis.', '**********   \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEndnotes \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t

Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R.', '314, by Chief Justice Lamer: “I cannot emphasize enough that the role of a trial judge in charging the jury is to decant and simplify” (para.', '13).', 'Brevity is the soul of a jury charge that actually helps the jurors to focus on their job provided its members are given an adequate understanding of the relationship between the essential elements of the evidence and the issues they are required to resolve.', '[3] \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The appellant argues that “[e]vidence critical to the defence case was not reviewed and the jurors were never told how the evidence that was referred to could support a defence to the charge of extortion” (Appellant’s Factum, at para.', '39).', 'We do not agree.', 'In applying the Azoulay principle to the circumstances of a particular trial, a trial judge must necessarily be vested with considerable latitude to determine how much or how little of the evidence is to be reviewed in relation to the elements of the charge.', 'Here the evidence took less than a day and a half.', 'The entire trial took place over three and a half consecutive days including jury addresses, instructions, deliberations and verdict.', 'There were only three witnesses.', 'The appellant did not testify (although a number of telephone conversations with him were recorded by the complainant and played to the jury).', 'The evidence was fully reviewed before the jury by defence counsel and the Crown immediately prior to the judge’s instruction.', 'The judge’s review of the evidence was succinct but adequate.', 'While we agree that juries may tend to place more weight on what a trial judge says about the evidence than on the argument by counsel, there was no objection to the charge from defence counsel.', 'Lack of objection is not fatal, but it may be informative, because defence counsel would have understood that additional evidentiary matters reviewed at his request might result in the judge repeating additional portions of the evidence requested by the prosecution on the same point, which might in the end have been expected to be more prejudicial than helpful to the defence.', 'Trial counsel are well situated to assess whether the judge has given the jury an adequate review of the evidence for the purpose of the defence theory being pursued.', '[4] \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Despite Mr. Carter’s able argument on behalf of the appellant we are not persuaded that the jury instruction failed to convey a sufficient understanding of the evidence and how it related to the issues raised by the defence.', 'The appeal is therefore dismissed.', 'Judgment accordingly.', 'Solicitors for the appellant:\\xa0\\xa0Bayne, Sellar, Boxall, Ottawa.', 'Solicitor for the respondent:\\xa0\\xa0Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, Toronto.', '* See Erratum [2009] 2 S.C.R.', 'iv.', 'New South WalesSupreme Court                                CITATION :     ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v QUINN [2007] NSWSC 456                                         HEARING DATE(S) :     Tuesday 8 May 2007                  \\xa0JUDGMENT DATE :\\xa0           9 May 2007                                               JURISDICTION :     Common Law                                         JUDGMENT OF :     Hall J at 1                                          DECISION :     (1) An order pursuant to s.16(1) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from 13 May 2007.', '(2) An order pursuant to s.20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the interim detention order referred to in order (1).', '(3) Two qualified psychiatrists are to be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by 1 June 2007.', '(4) The defendant is directed to attend those examinations.', 'CATCHWORDS :     Criminal law -

on 24 April 2007 pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act).', '2 The relief sought at the hearing on 8 May 2007 was an order pursuant to s.16(1) of the Act that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from 13 May 2007.', '3 The alternative relief sought is an order pursuant to s.8(1) of the Act that the defendant be subject to interim supervision for the same period.', '4 I observe at this point that the hearing of the application for a continuing detention order by way of a “preliminary hearing” is required to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after an application is filed: s.15(3) of the Act.', '5 In the case of a preliminary hearing, the Court is required to determine if it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order, as the case may be: s.7(4) and s.15(4) of the Act.', '6 The application is supported by the following affidavits:-                             (a) affidavit of Sharon Klamer affirmed 2 May 2007;                        (b) affidavit

May 2007;                        (e) affidavit of Denes Blazer affirmed 7 May 2007.', '7 In the observations which I make and in the conclusions and findings which I express in this judgment, I emphasise that in no way should I be understood as indicating that those observations or conclusions would necessarily apply in relation to any matter that would arise for consideration and determination on a final hearing of the matter.', 'The Act does not, in a preliminary hearing or in relation to an application for an interim order under the Act, provide for evidence or material tendered by the Attorney General to be challenged.', 'Nor does the Act make provision for material or evidence to be produced or tendered by the defendant at those stages.', 'That, however, can occur or take place at a hearing before any final order is made.', 'The statutory provisions                     8 The scheme established by the Act has been the subject of examination by McClellan CJ at CL in Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340.', 'It is sufficient for the purposes of the present application to confine attention to certain key provisions of the Act.', '9 Section 3 sets out the objects as follows:-                                        “The objects of this Act are to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as:-                                            (a) to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and                                             (b) to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders.”                              10 As McClellan CJ at CL observed in Gallagher, at [21], the fundamental objective of the legislature is the protection of the public which, where necessary, is intended to be achieved by supervision of an individual or if necessary by his or her continuing detention.', 'If an order is made, as his Honour there observed, the consequences may be the continuing incarceration of an individual or the imposition of serious restrictions on his or her liberty.', '11 On an application for an interim detention order under s.16 of the Act, the Court is required to be satisfied of three fundamental matters, namely:-                             (a) That the defendant is currently in custody in a correction centre serving a sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention for a         “serious sex offence”         or an         “offence of a sexual nature”        : s.14(1).', 'There was no issue taken in the present proceedings on this matter.', 'The requirement is satisfied on the evidence in the present application.', '(b) The defendant’s current custody is to expire before the proceedings for final orders: s.15(1)(a).', 'In this application, that requirement is satisfied as the defendant’s current sentence is due to expire on Sunday 13 May 2007.', '(c) That the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order: s.15(1)(b).', '12 A substantial amount of the evidence on this application was directed to this third requirement.', 'The statutory process: continuing detention orders                     13 A number of the provisions of the Act impose conditions as to time as follows:-                             • An application by the Attorney General under the Act may not be made until the last six months of the offender’s current custody: s.14(2).', '• A preliminary hearing into the application is to be conducted by the Supreme Court within 28 days after the application is filed in the Supreme Court or within such further time as the Court may allow: s.15(3).', '• An interim detention order must not exceed 28 days from the day on which it commences: s.16(2).', '• Interim detention orders may be renewed from time to time, but not so as to provide for the detention of the offender under such an order for periods totalling more than 3 months: s.16(3).', '14 I note at this point that s.16(1)(a) clearly envisages a situation whereby the offender’s current custody may expire before an application under the Act is heard and determined.', 'It is for that eventuality that power is vested in the Court to make interim detention orders under s.16.', '15 Proceedings under the Act are civil proceedings and to the extent that the Act does not provide for their conduct, such proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the law (including the rules of evidence) relating to civil proceedings (s.21).', '16 Proceedings under the Act are instituted by the Attorney General by application to this Court under Part 2 of the Act (in respect of “extended supervision orders” – meaning orders under s.9 and s.17 of the Act or under Part 3 in respect of “continuing detention orders” made under s.17 of the Act).', '17 Applications made under Part 2 or Part 3 may proceed:-                             (a) By way of a preliminary hearing (s.7(3) and s.15(3)).', '(b) Unless dismissed under s.7(5) or s.15(5), applications for either type of order referred to in the preceding paragraph are to be heard and finally determined in accordance with either s.9 or s.17 of the Act.', '18 Parts 2 and 3 both make provision for interim orders (interim supervision orders or interim detention orders).', 'Such orders, as earlier noted, may only operate for a finite term (28 days from the date of commencement of the order) unless renewed but for not more than 3 months: s.8(3) and s.16(3).', '19 In proceedings for interim orders under s.8 or s.16, the Court may receive and act upon supporting documentation.', 'It is clear from the terms of those sections that the rules of evidence do not apply in proceedings for interim orders.', 'Those provisions state, inter alia, that the Court may make an interim order if “it appears to … the Court”, inter alia, “that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing order or extended supervision order”.', 'The provisions for interim orders are, accordingly, less exact and demanding, at least as to their admissibility requirements concerning the material relied upon in the application for such inter orders than the actual evidence adduced in the proceedings by way of final determination.', 'So much is clear from the expressions in s.8(1)(b) and s.16(1)(b) “the matters alleged” and “would, if proved”.', '20 However, that said, the matters alleged or established in the supporting documentation on an application for an interim order under the Act must be such that “if proved” they would justify the making of a continuing supervision order or an extended supervision order: s.8(1)(b) and s.16(1)(b).', 'Accordingly, the supporting documentation must address matters that the Court will be required, in due course, to consider when determining proceedings under s.9 or s.17 of the Act.', 'These include “the safety of the community”.', '21 A question has been raised in these proceedings as to whether the Court has a residual discretion not to make interim orders even if it appears to the Court that the specified prerequisites in s.8 or s.16 are satisfied.', 'That, however, is not an issue that needs to be resolved in the present proceedings for reasons recorded below.', '22 In the present application, there is a substantial body of supporting documentation, much of which would be admissible on a hearing for final relief under the Act.', 'Whilst it is not specifically required by s.8(1)(b) or s.16(1)(b), given the significance to a defendant against whom an interim order is sought under the Act, it is obviously desirable, where possible, for the matters relied upon in support of an application for an interim order under the Act to be supported by material provided by those with direct knowledge of the facts concerning the individual offender.', 'That is certainly the case here.', '23 In an application for an interim order, it is necessary for the Court to determine whether, if proved, the relevant matters would justify the making of a continuing detention order or an extended supervision order: see in that respect, s.9(3) and s.17(4).', 'For that purpose, consideration must also be given to the provisions of s.17(2) and (3) which are in the following terms:-                                        “17(1) …                                            (2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he           or she is not kept under supervision.', '(3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she           is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.”                                        24 In the written submissions on behalf of the Attorney General (paragraph 93), reference was made to the preliminary view expressed by McClellan CJ at CL in Gallagher (supra) at [34] to the effect that the Act imposes a standard of proof higher than the ordinary civil standard but less than the criminal standard, beyond reasonable doubt.', 'This preliminary analysis was challenged and it was suggested that the Act “may fairly be viewed as imposing the ordinary civil standard of balance of probabilities – with the nature of the issue, and the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding, affecting the process of being satisfied to the requisite civil standard (cf.', 'Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1983) 60 CLR 336)”.', '25 I consider, by reason of the nature of the supporting documentation relied upon in the present application, that it is unnecessary to express any final opinion in relation to the provisions of s.17(3).', 'It is sufficient to say that the standard of persuasion in a civil proceeding in terms of the reasonable satisfaction of a tribunal as to whether a past event or fact has been established having regard, in particular, to the seriousness of an allegation made, the likelihood or otherwise of its occurrence and the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding (the Briginshaw test) may not be entirely applicable to the making of a determination under s.17(2) and (3).', 'Such a determination involves, not the establishment of a past fact or event, but the undertaking of a predictive risk assessment as to the degree of probability that a particular offender some time in the future is “likely” to commit a further serious sex offence in the circumstances to which those provisions refer.', 'No doubt, the nature and quality of the material used for such the making of an assessment will be vital.', 'Submissions on behalf of the defendant                     26 Mr M Austin of counsel, on behalf of the defendant, submitted that on the material provided, the Court would not make a determination that a continuing detention order is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.', 'He submitted in this respect that the material on the application merely discloses that the defendant, after almost nine years in custody, is “an untreated sex offender”.', 'It was further submitted that the defendant is not a person for whom the Custody Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) programme is appropriate.', 'Mr Austin submitted that the only proposition established by the material before the Court was that there is a programme for serious sex offenders and that the defendant has not completed that programme.', 'He submitted that whilst the programme may be the best programme “for the average or majority of inmates who could fall into the category of serious sex offenders”, it could not be suggested that the material in support of the application established that the programme was suitable for everyone and it was contended that it certainly was not suitable for the defendant.', '27 Accordingly, it was contended that the material relied upon in support of the application would not enable the Court to reach the conclusion required by s.16(1)(b), given, in particular, the high standard of proof that applies under s.17 of the Act.', '28 Mr Austin additionally relied upon the issue of delay in the making of the application.', '29 As I understood the contention made in relation to the issue of delay, it was that the legislation should be interpreted and understood as requiring any application for a continuing detention order to be made at a time which would enable the Court to conduct a preliminary hearing and, if necessary, make any interim orders within a period of six months.', '30 In the present proceedings, the complaint was that, by reason of delay, any interim order now made by the Court will result in the continued detention of the defendant beyond the current period of custody.', 'Had the application been made at an earlier point in time, a preliminary hearing could have been conducted and completed well within the six month period to which he referred and thereby have avoided the prospect of the defendant being further detained after having served nine years in custody.', '31 The submission on delay was linked with the submission that the Court ultimately will not be satisfied on the material so far presented that it is likely that a final determination will result in a continuing detention order being made.', 'I will return to these contentions below.', 'The relevant history of offences                     32 The defendant’s criminal record in relation to sexual offences, including the offence the subject of the current term of imprisonment, was set out in the detailed written submissions produced by Mr L Babb, Crown Advocate, and Dr D Kell, who appeared for the Attorney General.', 'Reproduced below is a schedule taken from paragraph 31 of those submissions:-

establishing that the sexual offence in respect of which the defendant is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, as well as the sexual offences in respect of which he was convicted on 8 December 1989, were both committed whilst the defendant was on release on parole following conviction on a prior sexual offence.', 'Matters under s.17(4) of the Act                     34 The documentation in support of the application includes a number of pre-release reports made by Ms Joanne Kennedy, Manager, Long Bay Parole Unit dated 23 March 2005, 14 April 2006 and 7 June 2006.', '35 The assessment and recommendation made in the report of 23 March 2005, is based upon interviews with the defendant and other sources of information identified in the report.', 'It is unnecessary here to detail the history and assessments referred to in it.', 'It is sufficient to say that the source materials relied upon, taken at face value, would support the recommendation stated therein, namely, that release of the defendant to parole was not recommended and that the most appropriate course for him was that he make a further application to join the next CUBIT Programme scheduled for later in that year (2005).', '36 The pre-sentence report dated 14 April 2006 referred to assessments of a medium risk of general re-offending and to a high risk of sexual/violent re-offending, each assessment being based upon the administration of “Instruments” or assessment tests.', 'The report records that the defendant’s circumstances remained unchanged and that otherwise he remained as “an untreated sex offender …” who continued to refuse to re-enter the CUBIT programme since his unsuccessful attempt in 2003.', '37 The supplementary pre-release report dated 7 June 2006 maintained the previous risk assessments and re-affirmed that release to parole posed “an unacceptable level of risk to the community”.', '38 The psychological risk assessment report dated 18 April 2007 by Sharon Klamer, psychologist, proceeds upon the basis of a detailed account of the historical sex offences committed by the defendant, his response to previous supervision, noting his breaches of parole, and his attitude to treatment and his attitude to risk.', '39 In light of the submissions made on behalf of the defendant, it is appropriate to observe that, according to Ms Klamer’s report (p.7), the defendant enrolled to participate in the Education of Sex Offenders Programme at Lithgow Correctional Centre in October 2003, but that he withdraw from the programme before completing it.', '40 The report also records that the defendant commenced treatment in the High Intensity Custody Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) on 17 March 2003.', 'The programme length varies between 8 and 12 months, depending upon progress.', 'The report records that the defendant was discharged from the programme at his own request on 5 May 2003 after six weeks in treatment.', 'His progress in treatment was described as poor, it being noted that there was a failure by him to accept responsibility for his general behaviour in the programme and two suspensions for threatening behaviour.', '41 On 2 June 2003, a Ms Shaw is recorded as having recommended that the defendant be re-referred to CUBIT and that he complete the programme “prior to his release”.', 'Ms Klamer’s report notes that information contained in reports compiled since that time in relation to the defendant’s interest, or lack thereof, in participating in treatment, was conflicting.', '42 Since 16 September 2006, the report records that there had been a number of written communications from the defendant in relation to him returning to the programme and the conditions under which he would agree to return.', 'These included requests by him that he recommence the programme from where he stopped in 2003, a refusal to discuss the index offence and his most recent prior convictions “due to the involvement of underworld figures” and a request to discuss these offences with the therapeutic manager or psychologist individually.', '43 In November 2006, the defendant was advised that he was not eligible to participate in a programme as he was due for release at the end of his sentence on 13 May 2007 and there was no longer sufficient time to complete the programme.', '44 On the evidence on this application, I am unable to accept the submission made on behalf of the defendant that the CUBIT programme was not an appropriate or was not a suitable one to meet his requirements.', '45 The affidavit of Ms Klamer sworn 2 May 2007, paragraph [45], stated that in her opinion, the only appropriate treatment programme for the defendant is the CUBIT programme.', 'Ms Klamer there also stated that there is no comparable programme available in the community for high risk offenders.', '46 Mr David Bright also addressed the issue in his affidavit sworn 2 May 2007.', 'Mr Bright is the Therapeutic Manager of CUBIT, Sex Offender Programmes at the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services.', '47 Correspondence with the defendant annexed to Mr Bright’s affidavit reveals that the reason for refusing to re-admit him to the CUBIT programme was not that he was considered as unsuitable or that the course was not an appropriate one for him.', 'Rather, the reason was that the conditions requested by him could not be met.', 'Subsequent correspondence referred to by Mr Bright indicates that the conditions which the defendant was seeking to have imposed upon his proposed re-entry to the programme were not acceptable.', 'Mr Bright’s conclusion expressed in his affidavit (paragraph 77) does suggest that the CUBIT treatment programme would be both appropriate and suitable for the defendant.', '48 The supporting material concerning the defendant’s convictions suggests a pattern of offending of an opportunistic nature and the difficulty that any such tendency may pose in terms of supervision taken with his prior history of breaches of parole, the assessments made of the defendant and his unwillingness to participate in the programme on the conditions specified in it, all constitute supporting material on this application for interim relief which would, if proved, justify the making of a continuing detention order.', '49 Ms Klamer stated in her affidavit that in February 2007, she was requested by the New South Wales Commissioner of Corrective Services to prepare a risk assessment report in respect of the defendant in anticipation of an application under the Act.', 'Ms Klamer undertook the assessment and produced a Risk Assessment Report dated 18 April 2007 which is Exhibit SK-1 to her abovementioned affidavit.', 'She interviewed the defendant on 27 February 2007 and 2 March 2007 for the purposes of making her assessment.', 'Ms Klamer stated that she also took a risk assessment relating to the defendant based upon both Static Risk Factors using the Static – 99 Actuarial Risk Assessment Tool and upon Dynamic Risk Factors.', 'Her overall assessment and conclusion was that the defendant is a high risk sex offender and that that assessment is based upon both of the abovementioned risk assessments.', 'Ms Klamer scored the defendant as a “9” on the Static – 99 by application of the Static – 99 Coding Rules.', 'Ms Klamer stated that, in her experience it is rare for an offender to receive a Static – 99 score as high as nine, which score places the defendant in the group of offenders in respect of whom there is a high risk of re-offending.', '50 Ms Klamer also addressed the Dynamic Risk Factors which involves a structured interview process undertaken with the offender and has regard to the individual offender’s psychological state and life circumstances.', 'Based on the Static and Dynamic Risk Factors, Ms Klamer assessed the defendant as being in the high risk category of sexually re-offending relative to other adult males (report, p.14).', '51 Having regard to the material on this application for an interim order which points to a limited amount of community support available to the defendant (in particular that that would be available from his female friend), the defendant’s previous pattern of offending and the assessments made as to his risk of re-offending, I am not presently persuaded that supervision as envisaged by the Act would provide sufficient protection from the assessed prospect of him re-offending.', '52 I am of the opinion that the material tendered on this application establishes a basis for the risk assessment referred to in the reports.', 'I also have regard to the defendant’s past conduct in not responding to the trust reposed in him when on parole.', 'Accordingly, I am not satisfied on this application that an extended supervision order would afford adequate community protection.', '53 On the issue of delay, I do not consider that I should accept that there has been relevant delay.', 'As indicated earlier, the Act expressly provides that an application may not be made until the last six months of the offender’s current custody or supervision: s.6(2) and s.14(2).', 'The Act does not specify a date by which an application must be made.', 'As earlier indicated, the direction for a risk assessment to be undertaken by Ms Klamer was given in February 2007 and there has not been any relevant delay since that time.', '54 I have had regard in considering the submissions made on behalf of the defendant to the fact that, prior to Ms Klamer advising the defendant that an assessment was to be made for the purposes of a possible application under the Act, he had an expectation that he would be released on 13 May 2007.', 'That, I accept, is an important matter in determining whether or not there is any relevant unfairness or detriment arising from the making of the application.', '55 I have concluded that, given the time periods prescribed in the legislative scheme, that it has not been established that relevant delay has occurred.', 'Even if there can be said to have been delay prior to February 2007, I do not consider that any such delay in itself has created a basis for refusing the application.', '56 The question of the exercise of any residual discretion referred to in paragraph [21] need not be determined as I am of the opinion that an interim detention order ought be made.', '57 I, accordingly, make orders in terms of paragraph (1) and (2) of the summons as follows:-                             (1) An order pursuant to s.16(1) of the         Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW)         that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from 13 May 2007.', '(2) An order pursuant to s.20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the interim detention order referred to in order (1) above.', '58 I, accordingly, direct that the above orders be entered forthwith and that an appropriate warrant issue.', '59 I emphasise, as I have indicated earlier, that the findings I have made have been made for the purpose of the application for an interim detention order pursuant to s.16 of the Act.', 'Those findings are based upon the material and evidence that has been placed before the Court for that purpose.', '60 The Act envisages that, following a preliminary hearing, if the Court is satisfied of matters referred to in s.16(4) of the Act, then the Court is to make orders appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the offender and to furnish reports to the Court on the results of those examinations and to direct the offender to attend such examinations.', '61 The hearing of the application for an interim detention order has addressed the matter that the Court is required to determine in a preliminary hearing under s.15(4) of the Act and I accept the submission that has been made on behalf of the Attorney General that the hearing of the application for an interim detention order constitutes the “preliminary hearing” under that provision.', 'In the case of such a hearing, the Court is required to determine if it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a continued detention order or an extended supervision order.', '62 Paragraph [4] of the summons seeks orders which the Court is empowered to make under s.15(4) of the Act.', 'On the basis of the findings to which I have referred, the plaintiff has established an entitlement to such orders.', '63 Accordingly, pursuant to s.15(4) of the Act, I make the following additional orders:-                             (3) Two qualified psychiatrists are to be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by 1 June 2007.', '(4) The defendant is directed to attend those examinations.', '64 Finally I record that, in order that the Court may determine at a final hearing the application that has been made for a continuing detention order, it must consider any admissible evidence that may be adduced on behalf of the defendant.', 'Accordingly, the legislation makes it clear that a finding required and made at this stage is preliminary in nature.', 'In proceedings for a final determination and a final order due regard must be given to the evidence in such proceedings, including, psychiatric reports to which I have referred.', '**********                                       \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t

remains on any person using material in the judgment or decision to ensure that the intended use of that material does not breach any such order or provision.', 'Further enquiries may be directed to the Registry of the Court or Tribunal in which it was generated.', 'Sentence  1HIS HONOUR: As a man in his early thirties Jeffrey Morris committed a number of very serious offences.', 'Mr Morris is now much older, in his mid fifties, and whilst he continued to offend after the offences for which he must be sentenced today, he did not repeat the most serious aspects of those offences.', '2The offender faces sentence today for four matters and asks that two matters be taken into account.', 'They are the offence of sexual intercourse without consent committed on 15 September 1988, an offence of break, enter and steal committed on the same day and when I sentence him for the break, enter and steal he asks that I take into account an offence of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse.', 'He also has to be sentenced for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent committed on 17 February 1990, an offence of break, enter and steal whilst armed committed on the same day and when I sentence him for that, the latter offence, he asks that I take into account an offence of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive instrument with intent to have sexual intercourse.', '3To put these offences in context Mr Morris was a man who, probably because of a substance abuse problem, committed many, many offences of break, enter and steal until, in about 2004 it would seem, he realised the futility of offending in that way and stopped.', 'Thus his criminal history shows many offences of break, enter and steal both before and after the offences which I must sentence.', 'But isolated within that criminal history are these two incidents in which the offender, as well as committing his usual offence of break, enter and steal, raped two vulnerable young women who were in their homes at the time.', 'Quite why Mr Morris chose to do what he did on these occasions is difficult to determine and indeed no satisfactory explanation has been advanced.', 'For obvious reasons Mr Austin who appears for Mr Morris today does not suggest that his substance abuse had anything to do with it.', 'Given the length and history of substance abuse and the isolated nature of the sexual offending there can be no suggestion of a relationship between those two matters.', '4I will turn now to look in a bit more detail at what the offender actually did.', 'I remind those present that there is to be no publication of anything which would identify or tend to identify the complainants whose names I will refer to in my recitation of the facts in these matters.', '5Ms\\xa0P lived in an address in Ultimo.', 'She got home sometime between 1am and 2am on 15 September 1988 and went to bed.', 'The house was locked when she did so.', \"At around eleven the following morning while Ms P was still asleep the offender broke a window and entered Ms P's home.\", 'She was woken up by the noise from downstairs.', \"The offender went into Ms P's bedroom.\", 'Without a word the offender walked to Ms P and punched her to her face splitting her lower lip.', 'Not surprisingly she was petrified and did not move.', \"The offender pulled down his pants, pulled off Ms P's underpants and commenced to have sexual intercourse with her by putting his penis into her vagina.\", \"The intercourse lasted about a minute before the offender ejaculated whilst his penis was in Ms P's vagina.\", \"After raping Ms P in this manner the offender simply stood up and left, taking, it would seem, Ms P's television and black handbag on the way out.\", 'Eventually Ms P phoned emergency services.', 'They arrived and a number of examinations were conducted.', 'They included DNA analysis of the semen which the offender had left behind.', \"It appears that a DNA sample was taken from Mr Morris in 2001 but it was not until much later that the match was made between the semen left behind at Ms P's home and the offender's DNA.\", '6The offender was arrested on 15 August 2011 in relation to this matter having previously been arrested in relation to a matter I will shortly deal with.', '7As one might expect any young woman assaulted in the way I have described in the sanctity of her own home would be significantly affected by the experience.', 'Ms P never returned to her house and had to give up her job.', 'One of the fears that she had was that as a result of what had happened to her she had contracted HIV/AIDS.', 'I will be speaking about this later but it must be remembered that when this offence occurred HIV/AIDS was almost inevitably fatal and testing for it was a lengthy process.', 'One can only imagine how awful it must have been for Ms P to have to wait the three months until testing finally revealed a negative result for HIV/AIDS.', '8We now move to 1990, 17 February.', 'On that occasion another young lady Ms RR was home alone.', 'She was eighteen years of age and lived with her family but they were out.', 'There was a knock at the door.', 'Ms RR saw the person who turned out to be the offender.', 'He asked for someone whom Ms RR did not know.', 'She said that she did not know anyone by that name and he left, but he came back.', 'It is important to understand in assessing the objective criminality of this offence that when Mr Morris came back he did so clearly intending to do what he eventually did, that is, rape Ms RR.', 'This was not some spur of the moment decision that he came to when in the course of committing a break, enter and steal.', 'He decided to rape an occupant he surprisingly found inside the premises.', \"It was the offender's plan to go back to the house and to enter it so that he could do what he eventually did.\", 'So he did go back to the house and again knocked at the door.', 'When Ms RR opened it again the offender pushed the door open causing Ms RR to fall to the ground.', 'He grabbed her and walked her towards the lounge room saying, \"I\\'ve got a knife\".', \"He pointed something metallic into Ms RR's side, she thinks it might have been a screwdriver rather than a knife but it was certainly a weapon capable of inflicting injury.\", '9He then walked her down the hallway towards the main bedroom at the front of the house and once he was there he pulled down her pants and underpants and pressed the metallic object against the bare skin of her waist.', 'She froze with fear, a very understandable reaction in the circumstances which presented themselves.', 'He then forced himself upon Ms RR causing her considerable pain as he had rough penile/vaginal intercourse with her.', 'Eventually he withdrew his penis and ejaculated on the fitted bed-sheet next to Ms RR.', 'He then did up his pants and walked away.', 'Ms RR noticed that she was bleeding from a tear in her vagina.', 'Before calling police she noticed that the VCR player had been taken from her home.', 'She called her sister but could barely speak because she was crying hysterically, and then called Triple-0.', '10Once again DNA analysis was successful with a profile being obtained which was later matched to the offender.', 'The offender was arrested for this offence at his place of employment on 27 July 2011 and has remained in custody since that day.', '11To say that these offences were objectively serious is something of an understatement.', 'The interference with the personal liberty and freedom of both complainants was substantial.', 'It is not an exaggeration to say that they were violated, by a complete stranger who thought nothing about the wellbeing of the complainants, but who was intent only on having intercourse with them, no matter the cost to them.', '12It is to be noted that the form of intercourse which occurred, penile/vaginal intercourse, is traditionally regarded as a form of intercourse which is particularly serious.', 'There is of course the risk of pregnancy.', 'There is the risk of sexually transmitted disease, including, as I have mentioned earlier, what was at that time the inevitably fatal disease of HIV/AIDS and on top of that there is the circumstance that penile/vaginal intercourse is an intensely personal experience.', '13I have to be careful not to double count here and of course I will not, but I do note that on both occasions the offender had forced his way into the homes of the complainants, places where they were entitled to feel secure.', \"14I have mentioned the offender's lengthy criminal history before.\", 'It resulted from a long history of substance abuse.', 'The offender is an aboriginal man.', 'He was born in western New South Wales but his parents separated when his mother was pregnant with him.', 'He has had little contact with his natural father over the years.', 'His mother remarried a non aboriginal man and the offender has five half brothers.', 'The family had a fairly itinerant lifestyle, moving from town to town in western New South Wales and he left school to assist the family by working.', \"The family eventually came to Sydney which is where the offender's problems with substance abuse really started.\", 'He spent many periods in custody and it is only of comparatively recent times that the offender has been able to put his problems with substance abuse behind him.', \"It is to be noted that the offender was working on the day he was arrested and that the offender's last serious offending was in 2004, although there have been a number of driving matters dealt with in the Local Court since then.\", \"15A psychologist's report was tendered but as I think I have mentioned there is little to explain why the offender would commit serious sexual offences on only two occasions in a long history of property crime.\", 'I should note that the offender was on parole at the time of the offences in 1990.', 'He was not actually on any form of conditional liberty at the time of the offences in 1988 but had been charged with a number of offences and was waiting to go to court for them.', '16The offender pleaded guilty to the offences on the indictment but these pleas were late and came on the day of the trial, although an indication that pleas would be entered came a few days earlier.', \"In those circumstances there has been no challenge to the Crown's submission that the discount for sentence should be in the order of ten per cent and that is the approximate discount that I have decided to allow because of the utilitarian benefit of the offender's pleas of guilty.\", '17The fact that these offences occurred so many years ago raises many problems in the sentencing exercise.', 'The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that the offender should be sentenced according to the range of sentences which existed at the time he would have been sentenced if he had been detected as the person who committed these crimes soon after they were committed.', 'That is not without its problems.', 'To give a specific example, when would the offender have been sentenced for an offence committed on 15 September 1988?', 'Would it have been before or after the commencement of the Sentencing Act which came into operation in 1989?', '18There has been some difficulty in many cases in assessing the sentencing range for particular offences where those offences were committed at times when sentencing statistics were not kept to the extent that they are now.', \"The authorities say that one tool which can be used is the individual judge's experience.\", 'Some judges have more experience than others.', 'Fortunately I am old enough to have been very much involved in the criminal law from the time that these offences were committed.', '19The parties assisted me with submissions and with printouts which confirmed my memory of the way in which offences such as these were treated in the late eighties and early nineties.', '20Another aspect of the sentencing exercise which relates to the length of time which has elapsed between when the offences were committed and now, is that the offender is quite a different person to the person he was back then.', '21As I mentioned earlier, since 2004 he has not committed a break enter and steal offence.', 'He has not committed any sexual offence since 1990.', 'It is not true I suppose to say that he has put his criminal ways entirely behind him but as far as sexual offending is concerned he has demonstrated that what it was which caused him to commit sexual offences in 1988 and 1990 no longer operates on his mind.', 'To that extent he has rehabilitated as far as sexual offending is concerned.', '22A similar thing can be said about break, enter and steal offences.', 'It took longer for the offender to give up offending of that kind but give it up he has.', 'I must not only sentence for the offences but also for the offender as he is today.', '23The offender says that he has no memory of the 1988 offence, but to a psychologist he expressed his remorse for the 1990 offence insofar at least as it concerned the rape of the young girl.', 'The offender did not give evidence today and so as the Crown submits less weight can be given to that expression of remorse but I will accept that the offender is remorseful for what he has done   24The offender, as an aboriginal man is entitled to have me consider the well known principles in Fernando v The Queen [1999] NSWCCA 66.', 'Often the upbringing of aboriginal children means that they are less able than others to make an informed decision as to whether they will commit crimes or not.', 'Where they are brought up in a community where substance abuse is more common than in other communities, the decision to do what many other people are doing in the community and to abuse substances yourself is one which is more easily made.', '25For those reasons I consider that the Fernando principles do apply to the break, enter and steal offences.', 'But I can see, as I have said before, no relationship between substance abuse and the sexual offending.', \"I can see no relationship between Mr Morris' Aboriginality and his decision to commit serious sexual offences on two young women.\", 'It is of course in a more general sense as Mr Austin said the case that the Fernando principles are relevant to the overall sentencing exercise and I have borne those principles in mind.', '26The harm that Mr Morris caused was enormous.', 'A victim impact statement was read on behalf of Ms RR.', 'It speaks eloquently of the harm which is entirely to be expected from a violation of the kind I have described.', 'To commit an offence of sexual intercourse without consent is an offence of sexual violence with often devastating consequences.', 'For that reason notwithstanding the relatively low maximum penalty which applied in 1988 for offences of sexual intercourse without consent, offences of that kind have always been regarded as particularly serious.', 'There needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence built into the sentences I will shortly announce.', 'As Mr Austin suggested, personal deterrence is of less importance perhaps because of the rehabilitation that the offender has achieved.', 'But other reasons for imposing a significant sentence such as retribution and general deterrence remain of great importance.', \"27The offender's criminality was very high indeed.\", \"One principle which applied in the criminal law for many years, and certainly applied in 1988 and 1990, is that any sentence imposed on an offender must reflect the objective gravity of that offender's crime and as in this case his offending was objectively very serious indeed, a lengthy sentence must result.\", \"28I will make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour.\", 'They are based on the circumstances that I will be accumulating sentence and also on the possibility, I put it no higher than that, that the offender would have been dealt with at a time when there was no rule relating to the relationship between a nonparole period and the head sentence.', 'However, as will be obvious when the calculations are done after I have announced my sentence, the variation from the statutory ratio is modest indeed.', '29I impose sentence as follows.', \"For the offence of break, enter and steal committed on 15 September 1988, taking into account the Form 1 matter attached to that offence, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two and a half years to date from the offender's arrest on 27 July 2011.\", 'For the offence of break, enter and steal whilst armed, committed on 17 February 1990, taking into account the Form 1 attached to that matter, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of three years to date from 27 January 2012.', 'Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentences that I will now announce.', '30For the offence of sexual intercourse without consent committed on 15 September 1988, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a nonparole period of three years, to commence on 27 January 2013 and there is a head sentence of five years on that matter.', 'For the offence of sexual intercourse without consent committed on 17 February 1990, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment.', 'I set a nonparole period of three years to commence on 27 January 2014 with a head sentence of five and a half years.', '31 Thus, the nonparole period will expire on 26 January 2017 and the overall sentence is to consist of a nonparole period of five and a half years, and a period of eligibility for parole of two and half years, making a total sentence of eight years.', '**********   \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t       \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply

pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of ongoing supply of cocaine contrary to s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.', 'This is an offence for which relevantly a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment is prescribed.', 'The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court and adhered to his plea of guilty before Judge Williams (the Judge).', 'He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 15 months.', 'He is to be released to parole on 11 July 2006.', 'The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.', '2 There was no dispute as to the facts of the three acts of supply of cocaine that gave rise to the offence charged.', 'On 14 January 2004, 27 January 2004 and 4 February 2004, the applicant supplied about a gram of cocaine on each date to an undercover police operative for the sum of $250.', 'He was arrested immediately after the third supply.', 'However, there was a significant dispute between the Crown and the applicant as to the circumstances in which those supplies occurred and, in particular, as to the extent of the applicant’s involvement in the supply of drugs in the community generally.', 'The sentencing hearing took place over almost two days in the course of which the undercover police officer and the applicant gave evidence.', '3 The applicant is aged 27 years.', 'He has no prior criminal record.', 'He is a student studying political science as part of a degree in Arts.', 'At the time of his arrest he lived with his girlfriend in an apartment in Bondi that was owned by her father.', 'The Judge accepted that the applicant was a heavy user of cocaine and cannabis.', '4 There was in evidence a report of Dr Whitten, a psychiatrist who had been treating the applicant as a result of his use of drugs.', 'The applicant told him that he first started using cocaine at the age 23 and cannabis from the age of 21.', 'He said that he had been supplying drugs to friends for three years before his arrest and saw it as a way of occupying his free time and as a way to socialise with others.', '5 The applicant had a disturbed childhood because his father was an international banker and the family were constantly travelling.', 'He told Dr Whitten that he attended 16 different schools in 12 years.', 'His parents’ marriage was marked by his father’s absence and domestic violence.', 'When the applicant was aged 10 his father disappeared and the applicant was left as the carer for his mother who was psychologically unstable.', 'His father died when the applicant was aged 16.', 'His mother resides in Austria and the applicant has a brother in Canada.', 'The applicant returned to Australia at the age of 20 and commenced his studies.', 'However, because of financial problems experienced by his family, he ceased studying after 18 months.', 'The applicant then had a series of jobs until returning to his studies in 2003.', '6 Dr Whitten diagnosed the applicant as suffering from depression and a panic disorder and he was placed on a course of anti-depressant medication.', 'He believed that the applicant’s prognosis was good, if he did not receive a custodial sentence, as the applicant intended to complete his studies and continue with his treatment.', 'Dr Whitten was of the opinion that the applicant “bought” friends by supplying drugs because of his lack of self-esteem.', 'He did not believe that the applicant supplied for profit but rather that the friends reimbursed the applicant for the cocaine supplied and that he did not supply outside his circle of friends,                   7 There is only one ground of appeal and it relates to the use of a finding that the Judge made about the applicant’s supply of cocaine to his friends and associates.', 'It is not contended that it was not open for the Judge to make that finding, and indeed the applicant admitted as much during the course of his evidence and to Dr Whitten.', 'Rather it is submitted that the Judge erred in taking into account that finding as an aggravating feature of the offence.', '8 A number of issues in dispute between the Crown and the applicant were resolved in the applicant’s favour.', 'For example, the Judge was not prepared to find that a large sum of cash in denominations of $100 and $50 notes found by police in the applicant’s premises was the proceeds of drug supplies generally.', 'Nor was the Judge prepared to find that the applicant used scales and a calculator found in the premises for the purpose of supplying drugs.', 'However, the Judge was not prepared to accept that a filofax found in the premises and that contained a list of names and sums of money written against each name was a record of amounts of money that the applicant had loaned to various people.', 'Nor was he prepared to find that the undercover officer had pressured the applicant into supplying drugs to her.', '9 The Judge made the following finding during the course of his sentencing remarks:                                                  When I have regard to the conversations with the undercover officer, the filofax document and the denominations of the money found in the apartment, I am satisfied that [the applicant] was in the business albeit at the bottom end of the scale of supplying cocaine in that he was available to supply cocaine to persons who became involved in his personal milieu.', 'The Judge also found that the applicant believed that the undercover officer was part of the group of people with whom he associated.', '10 The Crown asserted to the Judge that the applicant was a supplier of drugs generally by relying upon the scales found in the apartment and other objects that the Crown said were the indicia of a drug supplier.', 'But, as I have already indicated, the Judge was not prepared to make that finding other than that he supplied to a circle of friends.', 'Although the Crown was relying upon its assertion of the fact that the applicant was a drug supplier as a matter of aggravation, the Judge did not make that finding.', '11 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the Judge erroneously relied upon the fact that the applicant supplied to his friends in order to increase the sentence beyond the criminality contained in the charge before the court and so breached the principle in De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383.', '12 In R v Smiraldo (2000) 112 A Crim R 47 this Court considered the relevant principles to be applied when sentencing for an offence under s 25A.', \"Hulme J after indicating that the amount supplied was a relevant consideration, wrote:                                                  15 On the other hand, it would be wrong to look merely at the quantity supplied on the occasions which led to a conviction and attempt to judge an offender's conduct by that quantity and those provisions of the Act which impose penalties for supply and grade those penalties by reference to quantity.\", 'The persons at whom s25A is directed are those who appear to be indulging in a practice or business of supplying prohibited drugs.', 'It must, it seems to me, be relevant to consider the magnitude of such an operation.', 'As great a quantity of a prohibited drug may be supplied by a series of small transactions as by a few large ones and one may anticipate that most offenders charged under s25A will have been involved in the supply of far more than the particular quantities the subject of the occasions which have inspired the charge.', \"16 But there are likely to be constraints on how far it is permissible to go in any assessment of any overall quantity supplied in an offender's operation.\", 'Any conclusion that he or she had supplied a specified quantity, or at least that quantity, on occasions other than those relied on in the particular charge would run against the principle for which R v De Simone [sic] (1980-1981) 147 CLR 383 is commonly cited that, in sentencing, it is not appropriate to take into account as factors of aggravation, circumstances which would themselves constitute another offence which has not been charged.', \"17 However, subject to that qualification, the sentencing judge was entitled to take other matters into account if they bore on the Applicant's criminality and which were proved in accordance with the standards referred to in R v Olbrich (1999) 73 ALJR 1550.\", '13 In that case the judge sentenced the applicant on the basis that the supplies had been made in the course of a significant retail business for profit that was open 7 days a week.', 'There was no suggestion that the judge was wrong to sentence the applicant on that basis notwithstanding that the finding indicated other supplies by the offender than those charged against him.', '14 In R v Smith [2002] NSWCCA 278 it was held that evidence of the finding of drugs and drug dealing accoutrements in the applicant’s home was “relevant for the assessment of whether or not the present offences represented discrete episodes which were out of character for the applicant……”.', 'In relation to an argument that the sentencing judge wrongly took into account matters giving rise to further offences, Wood CJ said:                                                  12.', 'The decision of this Court in R v Smiroldo [2000] NSWCCA 120 at paras 15 to 17 does not, in my view, support the submission advanced on behalf of the applicant.', 'It was there made clear that a sentencing judge can have regard to those matters which throw light upon the practice or business of the offender standing for sentence, so long as that is not done in a way which would involve taking into account, as matters of aggravation, circumstances which would themselves constitute another more serious offence which has not been charged.', '15 His Honour also said:                                                  15.', 'It is not the case that a sentencing judge must confine the consideration of the objective criminality of an offender to the bare minimum of the available facts.', 'Subject to its proper use, a sentencing judge is entitled to have regard to all of the relevant evidence which throws light upon that issue.', '16 In the present case the Judge, after referring to the judgment of Dunford J in R v Hoon and Puna [2000] NSWCCA 137, held:                                                  Unfortunately [the applicant] could not be regarded as a retail courier as apparently were the respondents in the above case.', 'He is something more than that………                                 There is no suggestion that the Judge was wrong in forming that evaluation of the applicant’s role as a drug supplier.', '17 It my opinion there is no merit in this ground of appeal.', 'It is plain from a fair reading of the sentencing remarks that the Judge was simply determining the context in which the supplies to the undercover officer occurred.', 'The Judge was clearly entitled, if not required, to consider whether the charged incidents were isolated acts of supply or whether they were part of a course of conduct in which the applicant was engaged and the nature of that conduct.', 'He was simply making an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before him.', 'Although the Crown was submitting that the circumstances surrounding the supply amounted to an aggravating factor, the Judge rejected most of the Crown’s arguments.', 'There is nothing in the remarks on sentence nor in the sentence imposed to support the submission the Judge used his finding as to the applicant’s previous supplies in any way as a matter of aggravation such that he infringed the principle in De Simoni.', '18 I propose that the application for leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed.', '19 GROVE J: I agree.', '20 SULLY J: I also agree.', '21 GROVE J: The orders of the court are therefore

Honour: This is an application for bail pursuant to s21(6) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Commonwealth).', '2 A complaint having been filed charging the applicant with the murder of Kristina Garcia, a warrant for the arrest of the applicant was issued out of the Superior Court of California on 28 May 2002.', 'The deceased was known to the applicant.', 'She had been missing since 15 May 2002.', 'Her body was found on 23 May 2002.', 'The applicant flew from the United States to Sydney via Amsterdam and London, arriving in Australia on 27 May 2002 with a visitor’s visa for three months.', 'The applicant was ticketed to return to the United States in June 2002.', 'However he remained in Australia.', 'The applicant did not leave Australia on the expiration of the visitor’s visa in August 2002.', 'An application having been made on behalf of the United States for the issue of a warrant for the arrest of the applicant, the applicant was duly arrested on 19 September 2002.', '3 An application for an order for the surrender of the applicant was adjourned on several occasions before coming on for hearing on 16 December 2002.', 'On 16 December 2002, an order was made that the applicant was eligible for surrender to the United States of America in relation to an extradition offence and a warrant to that effect was issued pursuant to s21(9) of the Act.', 'The applicant has applied to this Court pursuant to s21(1) of the Act for review of the order.', 'The application is listed for directions on 10 February 2003.', '4 Section 21(6) provides that, so far as is presently relevant, that, where such an application for review has been made, the court may order the release on bail of the person on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit, “if there are special circumstances justifying such a course”.', '5 The meaning to be given to the phrase “special circumstances” in s21 of the Act is well settled by the authorities.', 'The following is an extract from the judgment of Goldberg J in Cabal v United Mexican States [2000] FCA 7.', '8 Section 3 of the Act sets out the principal objects of the Act, one of which is \"to enable Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties\".', 'In its original form s21(6)(f)(iv) did not require the threshold of the existence of \"special circumstances\" to be overcome before an applicant or an appellant could be released on bail.', 'It simply allowed the Court to \"order the release on bail of the person on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit\".', 'Section15(6) as originally enacted did contain a requirement for \"special circumstances\".', 'It provided:                                                                                              \"A magistrate shall not remand a person on bail under this section unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand.\"', 'The Explanatory Memorandum relating to the Extradition Bill 1987 contained the following statement in relation to the requirement for \"special circumstances\" in cl15(6):                                                                                                                   \"Subclause (6) provides that a person shall not be granted bail unless there are special circumstances.', 'Such a provision is considered necessary because experience has shown that there is a very high risk of persons sought for extraditable offences absconding.', 'In many cases the person is in Australia to avoid arrest in the country where he is alleged to have committed the offence, ie the person left the jurisdiction to avoid justice.\"', 'The Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Extradition Amendment Bill 1990 said in relation to the amendment which introduced the requirement of special circumstances into s21(6)(f)(iv):                                                                                                                   \"The purpose of this clause is to extend the presumption against bail which presently prevents a Magistrate remanding a person on bail ‘unless there are special circumstances justifying such remand\\' (subsections 15(6) and 32(3)).', 'The presumption is also to apply to the Supreme Courts of the States or Territories, the Federal Court or the High Court in the exercise of the power conferred by sub-paragraph 21(6)(f)(iv) to order the release on bail of a person who applies for a review of a Magistrate\\'s order, or who appeals against an order made on that review or on any subsequent level of appeal.\"', '9 In           Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions           (1991) 30 FCR 70 at 74 French J presumed that the policy underlying the requirement of \"special circumstances\" in s21(6)(f)(iv) was the same as the policy underlying \"special circumstances\" in s15(6).', 'I would, with respect, agree with this observation.', '10 The manner in which the expression \"special circumstances\" is to be construed has been considered in a number of cases.', 'In           Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions           (supra) French J said, in relation to \"special circumstances\" at 74:                                                                                              \"The reference to `special circumstances\\' in the context of this legislation imports a presumption against the grant of bail and puts the onus on the applicant to demonstrate that an order for bail would be justified.', 'There are two stages in the decision-making process under               s21              (6)(f).', 'The first involves the threshold question whether there are special circumstances of the kind contemplated by the section.', 'If that question is answered in the affirmative, the court must then consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, it should make an order for release of the applicant on bail and, if so, upon what terms or conditions.', 'The first question, whether there are special circumstances, involves a value judgment about which of the range of circumstances favouring the grant of bail are to be regarded as special and which are not.', 'That is a judgment to be made by reference to two criteria; the general purpose of the provision imposing the requirement and broader community standards.', 'The purpose of the special circumstances requirement imposed by               s21              (6)(f) is apparent from the nature of the legislation and the terms of the explanatory memorandum relating to the 1987 Bill and the equivalent provisions in               s15              .', \"It is to reduce what is perceived as `the very high risk of persons sought for extraditable offences absconding'.\", 'It looks in particular to the case where a person is in Australia to avoid arrest in the country in which he is alleged to have committed the offence.\"', 'In             Wu v Attorney-General of the Commonwealth             (1997) 79 FCR 303 the applicant claimed that the request for her extradition was an abuse of procedure and invalid.', 'Burchett J granted bail pending the hearing of her application.', \"His Honour was not exercising power under s21(6)(f)(iv) of the Act but was rather exercising the Court's inherent power to grant bail independently of statute.\", 'His Honour observed that the provisions of bail in s15 and s21 of the Act reflected legislative adherence to the common law principle and continued at 306-307:                                                                                                                   \"It seems to me that the common law\\'s `extreme care and caution\\' and the statute\\'s `special circumstances\\' are each intended to reflect the same matter - a high risk that a fugitive from his own country may fail to answer bail.', 'This was expressly held to be the basis of the statutory provisions in               Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions               (1991) 30 FCR 70 at 73-74, a decision of French J.', 'It is a consideration which should be applied bearing in mind the importance of the international obligation undertaken by Australia when it enters into extradition treaties ...\"                                                                                                                 Burchett J then considered decisions relating to expressions such as \"special reasons\" and \"special circumstances\" and said:                                                                                                                   \"These expositions of comparable uses of `special circumstances\\' support the view, which I hold, that the expression refers to circumstances different, in some way that provides a ground for considering a grant of bail more favourably, from those of the ordinary case of a fugitive remanded in custody.\"', '11 In           Bertran v Minister for Justice           (1999) 165 ALR 155, Sundberg and Merkel JJ cited this passage with approval and said at 161:                                                                                              \"In our view that is what the phrase `special circumstances justifying such remand\\' in               s15              (6) means - circumstances different in some way that provides a reason for a more favourable view of the grant of bail than that attending the ordinary run of extradition cases where a person might be expected to be remanded in custody.\"', 'As I observed recently in             von Arnim v Federal Republic of Germany             [1999] FCA 1747 at [17], some care must be exercised in applying authorities in relation to s15(6) of the Act to circumstances under s21(6) of the Act.', 'However, in my opinion, these observations of Sundberg and Merkel JJ apply to the expression \"special circumstances\" in s21(6)(f)(vi) of the Act.', 'Indeed at 164 Sundberg and Merkel JJ were generally in agreement, inter alia, with the observations of French J in             Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions             (supra) to which I have referred in par 10 above.', '12 In           Bertran v Minister for Justice           (supra) Finkelstein J concurred with the majority in dismissing the appeal but took what may be regarded as a view narrower than the majority in his approach to \"special circumstances\".', 'His Honour said at 168:                                                                                               \"However, in recognition of the fact that detention may cause an arrested person to suffer injustice, bail may be granted `in special circumstances\\'.', 'In my opinion this does not mean that the arrested person need only show something that does not exist in an ordinary case.', 'It means more than that.', 'To justify the grant of bail the arrested person must establish circumstances that are of sufficient weight to overcome the important reason why bail should ordinarily be refused.', 'Accordingly bail will ordinarily be refused unless the arrested person would suffer serious injustice if remanded in custody.', 'What will constitute serious injustice must be determined on a case by case basis.', 'It will include circumstances as diverse as a risk of serious deterioration of health if the arrested person is remanded in custody and cases where it is highly probable that the arrested person is not eligible for surrender.\"', 'There is force in his Honour\\'s observation but it does not, in my respectful opinion, pay sufficient regard to the fact that in order for something to be \"special\" there must be established some norm or fact by reference to which it can properly be characterised as \"special\".', 'It seems to me that this approach does not pay sufficient attention to the content of \"special\".', 'For example, in             Jess v Scott             (1986) 12 FCR 187 the Full Court in considering the content of the expression \"special reasons\" in O 52 r15(2) of the Federal Court Rules which allows the Court to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal said at 195:                                                                                                                   \"It is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served.\"', 'I therefore approach the question whether special circumstances exist for the purposes of s21(6)(f)(iv) by asking, consistently with the authorities to which I have referred, whether the circumstances relied upon are different from the circumstances which ordinarily apply where a person is in custody pending extradition proceedings and which by their nature warrant a more favourable view in relation to the grant of bail.', '13 The applicants submitted that I should construe \"special circumstances\" somewhat differently.', 'They pointed out that in The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 3rd ed \"special\" had a number of meanings

s21(6)(f)(iv) I should adopt the latter definition of \"special\" and ask what marks off the circumstances from other circumstances and what are their distinguishing features or qualities.', 'I do not, however, consider that this approach is consistent with the authorities to which I have referred.', '14 The authorities establish that the determination of whether bail should be granted under s21(6)(f)(iv) involves a two-step process.', 'In essence, the establishment of special circumstances is a threshold but once overcome there is a residual discretion in the Court.', 'As the majority (Sundberg and Merkel JJ) said in           Bertran v Minister for Justice           (supra) at 163:                                                                                              \"Special circumstances must exist before bail can be granted, but there is a discretion to be exercised after special circumstances are found.', 'It is not inappropriate to describe the first step as a condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction to grant bail: see Holt (at FCR 379) and Kainhoffer (at FCR 13).', 'It is a condition precedent in the sense that it is a requirement that must be satisfied, though its satisfaction does not conclude the decision-making process because there is still a discretion to be exercised.\"', '15 What are \"special circumstances\" will vary from case to case and there is no rigid demarcation between what circumstances are special and what circumstances are not.', 'In           Holt v Hogan (No 1)           (1993) 44 FCR 572 Cooper J considered the requirement of the existence of special circumstances and said at 579 that it involved a consideration:                                                                                              \"... whether the circumstances are such as to displace the ordinary rule against bail because the personal and other public interests underlying the proven circumstances outweigh the statutory interests and concerns evident in               ss3               and               21              (6)(f)(iv) of               the Act              .', 'Certain matters which touch a particular applicant, for example the time already spend in custody and the time the applicant faces in custody until the Court can determine the merits of the appeal, are matters that may be given considerable weight although in themselves they may not be decisive of the outcome in any particular case.\"', 'In Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions (supra) French J said at 74-75:                                                                                                                   \"In my opinion it can never be regarded as anything other than a special circumstance that a person should have to spend a year in prison unconvicted of any offence.\"', 'In that case his Honour found two special circumstances which justified the release of the appellant on bail pending the hearing of his appeal, namely his particular connection with Australia and the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that he was in Australia as a fugitive and secondly, the length of time that he would have spent in prison without trial if he was not released pending the appeal.', 'That period was in excess of one year.', '16 The determination of whether \"special circumstances\" exist must be considered by reference not only to circumstances which are \"special\" in the sense to which I have already referred but which must also take into account what French J referred to in           Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions           (supra) as \"broad community standards\".', 'In Holt v Hogan           (No 1) (supra) Cooper J took a similar approach and said at 578-579:                                                                                              \"In my view the correct approach is to start by identifying the policy and public interest underlying the provisions of               the Act              .', 'The principal objects of               the Act               are set out in               s3               ...                                                                                                                                             Additionally, one bears in mind the concern of he legislature, in providing that special circumstances be established before bail is considered, as reflected in the Explanatory Memorandum which accompanied the Extradition Bill in 1987, namely that experience has shown that there is a very high risk of persons sought for extraditable offences absconding.', 'As Foster J said in               Schoenmakers               (No 2), these circumstances dictate that the Court approach the matter with an attitude of circumspection.', 'Against these matters one then identifies and weighs the particular circumstances of the applicant for bail keeping in mind broad community standards including a predisposition against unnecessary or arbitrary detention in custody.', 'In considering the circumstances of a particular applicant for bail one does not exclude those circumstances which ordinarily would fall for consideration on an application for bail where a person is charged domestically for the commission of a crime in this country.', 'All personal circumstances are taken into consideration, notwithstanding that some or all of them will again fall for consideration if special circumstances are established as a condition precedent to the exercise of a jurisdiction to grant bail.', 'The special circumstances which the applicant for bail must establish are those which satisfy the Court that it is justified in departing from the presumption implicit in               s21              (6)(f)(iv) of               the Act               that ordinarily bail is not to be granted.', \"This is the same approach taken at common law where `special' or `exceptional' circumstances must be demonstrated (see for example               R v Ladd              ;               R v Murphy               (1958) 75 WN (NSW) 431 at 432-433).\", 'Of course, unless the Court was satisfied that it as not probable that the applicant would abscond, it is hard to imagine any situation where special circumstances would be made out.', 'But in assessing that probability regard may be had to the personal circumstances of the applicant and the ability of the Court to impose conditions which maximise the likelihood that an applicant will answer bail.', 'It is not in my view that the circumstances are so exceptional or special that it is not probable that the applicant will abscond which is the sole or appropriate test required by               s21              (6)(f)(iv), but rather whether the circumstances are such as to displace the ordinary rule against bail because the personal and other public interests underlying the proven circumstances outweigh the statutory interests and concerns evident in               ss3               and               21              (6)(f)(iv) of               the Act              .', 'Certain matters which touch a particular applicant, for example the time already spend in custody and the time the applicant faces in custody until the Court can determine the merits of the appeal, are matters that may be given considerable weight although in themselves they may not be decisive of the outcome in any particular case.\"', '17 In           Bertran v Minister for Justice           (supra) the majority of the Court agreed with these observations, as they had with the observations of French J in           Schoenmakers v Director of Public Prosecutions           (supra) as to the manner in which the Court should approach the issue of special circumstances under s21(6)(f)(iv).', 'The majority then made observations in relation to s15(6) of the Act which, in my opinion, are also applicable to s21(6)(f)(iv) of the Act.', 'Their Honours said at 164:                                                                                               \"Under s15(6) one starts with the presumption implicit in the subsection, and explicit in the explanatory memorandum, that ordinarily bail is not to be granted.', 'One then asks whether an applicant has established the existence of special circumstances which displace that presumption.', \"One does not ask whether there are special circumstances in the abstract but whether there are `special circumstances justifying such remand'.\", 'In answering the question it is appropriate to take into account the particular circumstances of the applicant together with the broad community standards including a predisposition against unnecessary detention in custody.\"', 'Of course, under s21(6)(f)(iv) one is not concerned with \"special circumstances justifying such remand\" but rather whether there are \"special circumstances justifying such a course\", namely the course of ordering \"the release of [the applicant or appellant] on bail on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit.\"', \"18 It is important, in my view, to take an overall view of the circumstances which attend upon the applicants' applications for bail when considering whether there are relevant circumstances.\", 'Individual or specific circumstances may not, of themselves, be special in any relevant way but an accumulation of non-special circumstances may well build up into an overall special circumstance or special circumstances.', 'Further there may be an inter-relationship between different circumstances which will heighten the significance of each circumstance.', '6 I respectfully agree with this statement as to the effect of the authorities.', '7 The matters relied upon as allegedly constituting special circumstances in the present case were as follows.', '(a) The need to be at liberty in order to assist in the preparation of the application for review of the order for surrender.', '(b) The need to be at liberty in order to contact his family for funds.', '(c) Oppressive conditions in prison.', '(d) Financial and emotional hardship.', '(e) Excessive time in prison pending resolution of the extradition proceedings.', 'I will deal with these considerations in turn.', '(a) The need to be at liberty in order to assist in the preparation of the application for review.', '8 Ms McGowan appeared for the applicant in the present application pro bono.', 'She informed the court that she intended to brief counsel to appear in the application for review of the order for surrender of the applicant.', 'In these circumstances, this consideration carries little weight.', \"(b) The need to be at liberty in order to contact the applicant's family for funds.\", \"9 The Court was informed from the bar table that the applicant’s family had disowned him and that they refused to speak to Ms McGowan, that this was because they had been prejudiced against the applicant by the authorities in the United States, that there was the prospect that the family's attitude would be different if the applicant spoke to them direct, that funds for prosecuting the application for review might then be forthcoming, and that it was not practicable for the applicant to make contact with his family by telephone from the prison.\", '10 There was no evidence of these matters.', 'However, taking what was said at face value, the prospect that money for legal fees would be obtained from the applicant’s family were he released pending determination of the application for review is speculative in the extreme.', 'More particularly, the applicant has been fortunate in obtaining the services of Ms McGowan pro bono and she seems confident that she will be able to brief counsel – again, presumably pro bono – to appear for the applicant in the proceedings.', '11 In these circumstances, this consideration also carries little weight.', '(c) Oppressive conditions in prison.', '12 The evidence is of complaint by the applicant on formal complaint forms that there has been a course of oppressive harassment by prison officers directed towards the applicant, including unnecessary strip searching, apparently in retaliation for other complaints, and a threat of placing the applicant where he might be beaten up or worse by a violent inmate.', 'The complaint in relation to the last of these matters was made as recently as 17 January 2003.', 'It was marked for the attention of the Governor of the gaol and a copy is being transmitted by Ms McGowan to the American Consulate.', '13 I expect that the applicant’s complaints will be appropriately investigated and that any action found to be necessary as a result of such investigation will be taken.', 'Nonetheless, it appears, on the material before me, that the applicant has been subjected to tougher treatment than is reasonably to be expected under ordinary prison conditions, and that this might continue to be so.', 'On the other hand, it has also to be recognised that prison conditions are, by their nature, unavoidably oppressive and demeaning to some degree.', '14 These matters are relevant to the issue of special circumstances and are to be given due weight.', '(d) Financial and emotional hardship.', '15 Reliance was placed on what was said to be disinformation concerning the applicant’s criminal history in the army, appearing in various news services on the world wide web.', 'Distressing though such disinformation may be to the applicant, it is not a special circumstance of the relevant kind.', 'It would not be relieved by a grant of bail.', '(e) Excessive time in prison pending resolution of the extradition proceedings.', '16 It is to be expected that the application for review will be heard promptly after the listing on 10 February.', \"Having regard to the timetable under s17 of the Act and the need to obtain documentation from the United States in support of the application, the three months which has expired since the applicant's arrest is not unusual or inordinate.\", 'The time in prison pending resolution of the extradition proceedings is not shown to be excessive in the present case.', 'Conclusion                     17 It was said from the bar table that the applicant had previously arranged to leave the United States on holiday and that his departure was unrelated to the investigation which led to the charge of murder being laid against him.', 'There is no evidence of the travel arrangements having been made earlier than 20 May 2002.', 'It is true, that at that stage, the deceased was listed as a missing person, her body not yet having been found.', 'However, the applicant’s departure from the United States, as and when he did, is to be evaluated in the light of the fact that, having been arrested in Australia, he has opposed extradition to the United States to face the charge brought against him.', 'It is difficult to avoid the inference, in these circumstances, that he fled the United States in order to avoid facing the charge.', 'In these circumstance, the risk that an apprehended fugitive will abscond exists in the present case.', '18 Having evaluated the matters relied upon as special circumstances, I am not satisfied that they constitute anything so different from the ordinary case as to satisfy that condition for the grant of bail.', '19 Accordingly, the application is refused.', '-o0o-                                                Last Modified: 01/30/2003    \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t       \\t\\t\\t

as a separate question, and on a strike out application under r 14.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), as explained by the Court of Appeal in Younan v Nationwide News [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20].\", \"7The question to be determined is whether, on the balance of probabilities, each of the plaintiff's imputations objected to on that basis is reasonably capable of being conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader: King v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 490.\", 'Where the basis of the objection is one of form, the requirement is that the imputation must specify the act or condition allegedly attributed to the plaintiff by the matter complained of with sufficient clarity to enable the defendants to know the case they have to meet: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135.', 'Imputations 4(a) and 4(b)  8Counsel for the defendants submits that these imputations cannot arise at the same time and should be permitted only as alternatives.', 'Counsel for the plaintiff submits that these imputations are not mutually exclusive and not alternatives, in much the same way that a person who is a lawyer or doctor can still be called a lawyer or doctor, even after they have ceased to practise, or been struck off; similarly, it is argued, a person who is married will \"not forever have the status of being married\" (submissions, page 1).', '9In Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 148B - C Gleeson CJ noted the longstanding rule, set out in Feros v West Sydney Radio Pty Ltd (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 22 June 1982, unreported) that a plaintiff may not in pleading allege two inconsistent or contradictory imputations, affecting the capacity of the imputation pleaded to convey a defamatory meaning (see also Tingle & Anor v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd & Anor (No 2) [1999] NSWSC 414 at [17]).', '10I am satisfied that the imputations are inconsistent, in that the jury cannot find that both imputations are conveyed.', 'Either the plaintiff is a stripper, or she is a former stripper.', 'Similarly, a person cannot be a doctor and a former doctor at the same time.', 'While it is possible to marry more than once and to be both divorced and married to some other person at the same time, this analogy is of no assistance.', 'Being a former stripper is inconsistent with being a stripper and, in accordance with the principles explained by Hunt A-JA in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [75], they must be pleaded as alternatives.', '11Is being called a former stripper less defamatory than being called a stripper?', 'Should the imputation of being a former stripper be pleaded as a fall-back imputation?', 'There is still utility in having fall-back imputations of lesser severity: see the discussion of this issue in King v John Fairfax Media Publications at [15] - [16].', 'Although I raised this issue with Mr Rasmussen, there is no need for me to make such a ruling; I shall leave it to the plaintiff to determine which of these two imputations should be pleaded first, and whether one is a fall-back for the other or only an alternative.', '12I have accordingly made orders for these imputations to be pleaded as alternatives to each other.', 'Imputations 4(e) and 6(c): \"the plaintiff is a ridiculous person\"   13The defendants do not challenge the concept of ridicule as not being actionable (as to which see the line of authority running from Villers v Monsley (1769) 2 Wils 403, 95 ER 886 to Boyd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 449), but object to the form of the imputation, in that its imprecision is such that no act or condition is identified.', '14Both parties referred to Scali v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 15 July 1993), where the matter complained of made a derisive reference to a particularly garish interior design as being \"like Nick Scali on acid\".', 'The plaintiff, a respected manufacturer of furniture of an Italianate style, brought proceedings for defamation and pleaded the following imputation:  \"(e) That the First Plaintiff, by reason of his lacking in good taste in respect to furniture and interior decorations, is deserving of being held up to public ridicule.\"', '15Levine J struck out the imputation, stating that the phrase \"is deserving of being held up to public ridicule\" was, absent clear words in the publication, an unwarranted \"appendage\" (at page 2) as well as a rhetorical flourish (at page 3).', '16Contrary to the plaintiff\\'s submissions, his Honour did not consider that an imputation that the plaintiff was ridiculous, absent the appendage of \"deserving\", could arise.', 'His Honour\\'s complaint (which he illustrated by referring to a similar attempt to avoid pleading the facts of the publication), was:  \"...', 'I was referred to a recent decision of Mathews J in George Polatidis v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd, Friday, 4 June 1993, in which her Honour was dealing with, inter alia, an imputation in relation to a comment upon a restaurant, \"the plaintiff conducts a cafe which is unfit to be patronised\" in which her Honour, with respect correctly in my view, held that it was a far cry from saying that the plaintiff\\'s establishment serves sub-standard food, or that some of the cutlery it supplies is grubby, to saying that it is in the general sense unfit or undeserving to be patronised (p4).', '17The imputation does not \"reflect\" the stings in the article, as claimed by the plaintiff in her counsel\\'s submissions (page 2), but seeks to hide from them, in much the same was that the restaurant owner referred to above sought to avoid the factual allegations of serving sub-standard food, or having grubby cutlery, by an imputation that his café was unfit to be patronised.', '18Mr Rasmussen also referred to Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1850 at [13] - [25] where McCallum J allowed an imputation \"the plaintiff is a joke\" to go to the jury, but in the \"unique circumstances\" where the matter complained of was clearly constructed as an attempt at humour.', '19That is not the case here.', 'The first matter complained of is a news report on the murder trial in which the plaintiff\\'s boyfriend was convicted and her \"bizarre protest\" outside the sentencing in which she and others held up placards outside the court protesting his innocence and questioning evidence in the trial; it is illustrated with photographs of the plaintiff holding up those signs.', 'The second matter complained of is an account of the plaintiff visiting her former boyfriend in prison after his conviction and describes statements she had made in a media interview, as well as to how she \"bizarrely\" re-enacted the crime for the media cameras.', '20Each of the matters complained of contains a series of factual statements or opinions about the plaintiff.', 'For the reasons explained by Levine J in Scali v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd, the plaintiff should distil the sting of this imputation from the contents of the matter complained of rather than avoid them by pleading what both Levine J and Mathews J called a rhetorical imputation.', 'Additionally, as the Court pointed out in Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 at [31] (set out below), the defendants should not be called upon to defend such an imprecise and wide imputation.', '21It is easy to demonstrate how a factual statement in the matter complained of can import ridiculousness and how the imputation to that effect should be pleaded.', 'For example, in Boyd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (where the plaintiff was a well-known footballer), the article, headed \"BOYD IS FAT, SLOW AND PREDICTABLE\", describes the journalist\\'s astonishment as the portly plaintiff \"waddled into the sunshine\" to play for the Sea Eagles against South Sydney.', 'The imputation pleaded was that the plaintiff, a footballer, was so fat as to appear ridiculous when he came onto the field to play, which imputation arose from the word \"waddled\" and the incredulity of the author at the plaintiff\\'s appearance.', '22Whether the plaintiff is able to extract such an imputation from either of the matters complained of in these proceedings is a matter for the pleader.', '23Imputations 4(e) and 6 (c) are struck out.', 'Leave to replead is not appropriate, as any imputation that some act or condition of the plaintiff made her appear ridiculous will be so different in form and content as to be an entirely new imputation.', 'Imputation 6(d)   24The objection to this imputation is that it does not arise, as well as being defective in form.', \"25The matter complained of clearly conveys the imputation that the plaintiff is deluded in her belief in Simon Gittany's innocence (imputations 6(a) and 6(b)).\", 'Mr Rasmussen\\'s written submissions state that an imputation of stupidity is also conveyed because \"[a]ny person who believes in the innocence of Gittany in the face of those assertions must be stupid\", adding that a person can \"wake up\" from a delusion, while \"stupid is forever\" (plaintiff\\'s submissions, page 2).', '26The statement of claim reveals that the same passages in the matter complained of are asserted to give rise to the imputations of being deluded as well as stupid.', 'Judging by Mr Rasmussen\\'s submissions, he considers \"stupid\" is a more permanent state of being \"deluded\".', '27This argument suffers from two vices.', 'First, this is contrary to the dictionary definition of \"stupid\", which generally connotes intellectual limitations rather than being deluded on a permanent basis.', \"Secondly, if what is intended is a form of delusion rather than the plaintiff's intellectual imputations, the imputation is ambiguous.\", '28The plaintiff relies upon Toben v Milne in support of his entitlement to plead this imputation.', \"However, the careful analysis of potentially ambiguous imputations by the Court of Appeal in Toben v Milne supports the defendants' contentions, and not those of the plaintiff.\", 'The imputation the Court found to be ambiguous in Toben v Milne was that the plaintiff \"fabricated history\".', 'This was because, as the Court noted at [31], the imputation was \"too vague and imprecise\":  \"In our view, imputation (a) in its present form is too vague and imprecise.', 'The comment, \"people like [the appellant] engage in fabrication of history\" was made in the context of a condemnation of \"holocaust denials\", or anti-Semitism, or both.', 'It was not made in the broad and general sense that imputation (a) presently conveys.', 'The respondent should not be required to defend such an imprecise and wide imputation.', 'If the appellant wishes to rely on an imputation relating to the fabrication of history, he ought to be required to plead the imputation having regard to the context of the article as a whole.\"', '29The ambiguity of \"fabricated history\" arose in Toben v Milne because of the potential to include holocaust denials and/or anti-Semitism (or both).', 'The broad and general sense of the imputation meant that it could connote other historical fabrications, such as a false history of a war (at [28]) or of other holocausts (although I note, in passing, that the similar facts of other holocausts must present a conceptual problems to holocaust deniers generally).', '30That same ambiguity is present here.', \"The matter complained of does not convey an imputation that the plaintiff is stupid in the sense of having intellectual limitations, and any imputation that her continued belief in Simon Gittany's innocence is deluded is caught up by imputations 6(a) and 6(b).\", 'Conformably with my findings concerning imputations 4(e) and 6(c), imputation 6(d) is struck out.', 'Orders  (1)Imputations 4(a) and 4(b) are to be pleaded in the alternative and will go to the jury.', '(2)Imputations 4(c), 4(d), 6(a) and 6(b) will go to the jury.', '(3)Imputations 4(e), 6(c) and 6 (d) are struck out.', '(4)Plaintiff to file and serve Amended

these up.', 'Cpl Rajandran then proceeded, with the clutch bag and its contents, to the lock-up where, in the presence of the accused, he counted the 24 sachets of powder that were in the yellow envelope.', 'He then reported the recovery of the clutch bag containing the 24 sachets and the arrest of the accused and Sanusi to Sgt Lai Thong Fock (Sgt Lai).', 'Sgt Lai relayed this information to ASP Lim Chei Yoo (ASP Lim) of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and asked if CNB would want to take over the case.', 'He was told to interview the two persons first.', 'It appeared from the evidence of Sgt Lai that CNB would take over the case only if the accused was trafficking in the 24 sachets.', 'In compliance with the direction of ASP Lim, Sgt Lai interviewed the accused from 2.15pm to 2.30pm that day and interviewed Sanusi immediately thereafter.', 'Later at about 6.20pm just before leaving office he noted what the accused told him in his pocket book.', 'The prosecution sought to adduce in evidence the conversation between the accused and Sgt Lai and the extract from the pocket book.', 'The defence objected to this conversation or the extract from the pocket book being admitted in evidence and a trial-within-a-trial was held to determine admissibility.', 'Before the commencement of the trial-within-a-trial Sanusi was called to testify for the prosecution.', 'All that the prosecution sought to adduce from Sanusi was that the clutch bag belonged to the accused and Sanusi did not know that there was heroin therein.', 'The defence, however, sought to adduce evidence from Sanusi that he and the accused had been consuming heroin together at the Pasir Ris site.', 'It was obvious when defence counsel began questioning Sanusi that Sanusi was a very frightened man.', 'He claimed to have known the accused for only one or two months prior to arrest.', 'Sanusi, however, agreed that at a construction site at Pasir Ris he and the accused had consumed heroin together.', 'He denied that he worked at that site and said that he did not know if the accused worked there.', 'He also denied having been arrested for drug activities at any time prior to 6 July 1994.', 'As the questioning progressed it became progressively more apparent that Sanusi was very uneasy about answering questions.', 'He was on several occasions not even speaking out his answers.', 'Counsel for the defence pointed out that at the preliminary inquiry Sanusi, when questioned, had denied knowing the accused at all.', 'When I asked Sanusi to speak up Sanusi claimed that he had a sore throat.', 'At that stage I decided that it would be best that the cross-examination of Sanusi be stood down until a later date.', 'First trial-within-a-trial  Sgt Lai told the court that he interviewed the accused in English.', 'He said that the accused could understand English and so he did not ask the accused whether he wished to speak in Malay.', 'Before interviewing the accused he laid out the 24 sachets on the table in front of the accused and counted the 24 sachets.', 'He then questioned the accused.', 'Sgt Lai said that he jotted down what the accused said in note form on a piece of paper.', 'At about 6.20pm that evening just before he left the station, Sgt Lai wrote out in his pocket book an expanded account of what he had noted on the paper.', 'He then destroyed the piece of paper.', 'At that time he also recorded on his pocket book other events that had taken place in the day such as what Cpl Rajandran told him about the arrest, his telephone call to ASP Lim and his interview with Sanusi.', 'He agreed with counsel that he was in a hurry when he made the entries in his pocket book as he had to take a bus and get to a management class scheduled to begin at 7pm at Paterson Road.', 'Sgt Lai agreed that the assignment by ASP Lim to interview the accused was an important assignment.', 'He was aware that if the accused was trafficking in the heroin the accused would face the death penalty.', 'When asked why, in spite of this knowledge, he did not record a proper statement from the accused, have it read back to the accused and get the accused to sign it or at least have his pocket book with him and note what the accused said in the pocket book, Sgt Lai responded that as he was in the vicinity just prior to the interview and he did not take the trouble to go up to his office and take his pocket book.', 'Sgt Lai told the court that as a plainclothes officer he was not expected to carry his pocket book with him and it was his practice to leave his pocket book in the drawer in his office and make entries therein only when he was free.', 'I found it difficult to believe Sgt Lai`s claims as to how pocket books were to be entered.', 'It might be acceptable not to take notes at all or to jot notes on a piece of paper where an officer was on surveillance duty but to suggest that it was accepted practice, in the context of a formal interview with an accused person, to make notes on a piece of paper and then destroy the notes after transcribing the contents into his pocket book was an assertion that I found very surprising.', 'If that was so, it would defeat the whole purpose of having pocket books.', 'I therefore asked the learned DPP to produce in court the directions, if any, issued by the Police Force in respect of the maintenance of pocket books.', 'Through Sgt Lai, the Police General Orders (PGO) on the subject was produced.', 'What the PGO said was quite contrary to the claim made by Sgt Lai.', 'The PGO made it obligatory for police officers (uniformed or not) to keep pocket books with them at all times and it contained very clear and eminently sensible directions on how pocket books were to be maintained.', 'It was provided for instance, in O 4, that entries `shall be made in the pocket book whenever possible at the time of occurrence`.', 'An officer in plainclothes in order to prevent disclosure of his identity was permitted under O 4 to make notes on a piece of paper but such notes had to be copied into the pocket book as soon as possible and the original retained as an exhibit in case of need.', 'Order 6 provided that entries should be clearly written in indelible ink, that entries should be recorded chronologically on serially numbered pages, that no erasures should be made, that if any correction was to be made the erroneous entry was to be crossed out in such a way that it was still legible, that there should be no space left blank between entries and leaves should not, for any purpose, be torn out of pocket books.', 'Order 6 also stated that to ensure reliability of the pocket book the provisions therein should be `strictly complied with`.', 'Order 7 provided that where occurrences recorded in pocket books were likely to become the subject of legal proceedings they should be recorded in the fullest possible detail including `actual words of relevant statements`.', 'To ensure that police officers kept their pocket books properly, it was even provided that pocket books were to be checked weekly by supervising officers and it was provided (in O 8) that where a pocket book is used to record a statement, the statement shall be recorded in compliance with s 121(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC).', 'When confronted with the provisions of the PGO and asked if he knew of those provisions, Sgt Lai admitted that he did.', 'When asked why he had not followed them, Sgt Lai claimed that he had forgotten about them.', 'Sgt Lai told the court that when he interviewed the accused, the accused looked normal and, except for looking tired, did not appear to be suffering from drug withdrawal.', 'It would appear, however, that Sgt Lai knew that the accused was in fact a drug addict.', 'In the extract from the pocket book that the prosecution was seeking to admit in evidence Sgt Lai had noted that, at 11.30am that morning, Cpl Rajandran had informed him that the accused was arrested for the possession of 24 sachets of heroin, for suspicion of consuming drugs and for failing to report for urine test.', 'Sgt Lai agreed that in drug withdrawal there were a number of symptoms like chill, vomiting and diarrhoea that would not be apparent to him when he interviewed the accused.', 'He agreed that he did not ask the accused if he was all right.', 'He said that as the accused appeared normal it did not occur to him that it would be preferable to send the accused for a medical examination of his drug condition prior to recording any statement from him.', 'In his pocket book Sgt Lai had recorded the accused as having said that he `  intended  ` to sell the `  sachets of powdery substance  ` for $150 a sachet.', 'When it was put to Sgt Lai that the accused could not have used the word `intended` as the accused would not know the meaning of that word, Sgt Lai disagreed.', 'There was at that stage a pause in the questioning in order to locate the extract from the pocket book to see the actual words recorded therein.', 'During this pause Sgt Lai changed his testimony.', 'He said that although in the pocket book he had put down the word `intended` the accused had in fact said he `wanted` to sell the drugs.', 'When asked why he used the word `intended` when the accused had used the word `wanted`, Sgt Lai replied that to him `intended` and `wanted` had the same meaning and so he wrote down `intended`.', 'When pressed why he did so he replied that he was not careful when he recorded into the pocket book.', 'When I commented that it appeared to me that Sgt Lai had changed his testimony because he probably realized that the accused`s command of English would not be high enough to have used a word like `intended`, Sgt Lai agreed that that was so.', 'Cpl Rajandran told the court that when he went to the accused`s cell that afternoon to fetch the accused for interview by Sgt Lai, he found the accused asleep.', 'He had to wake the accused up before he could escort the accused to the interview room.', 'Cpl Rajandran confirmed that during the interview the accused looked sleepy.', 'Cpl Rajandran also told the court, both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination, that during the interview he saw Sgt Lai write down the questions asked and the answers given on a piece of paper.', 'In re-examination, the prosecution tried to establish that as Cpl Rajandran did not actually read what Sgt Lai wrote he would not be able to say whether he was writing down the questions as well as the answers.', 'Cpl Rajandran confirmed that he did not actually read what Sgt Lai wrote.', 'At the request of the defence the prosecution called Sanusi and offered Sanusi for cross-examination for the purposes of the trial-within-a-trial.', 'Counsel for the defence sought a ruling from the court that Sanusi should not be a prosecution witness but should be a defence witness.', 'Counsel complained that what the prosecution was seeking to do by making Sanusi a prosecution witness was to deny to the defence the opportunity of interviewing Sanusi and preparing its defence with the benefit of such an interview.', 'I refused this application.', 'If the prosecution chose to call as a witness a person who should obviously be a defence witness, the prosecution ran the risk of their witness turning hostile.', 'But that was a matter for the prosecution to decide.', 'Clearly, it was not the province of the court to decide for the prosecution whom they should or should not call as their witness.', 'In view of the impression I had formed earlier about Sanusi`s reluctance to testify about his association with the accused, I explained to Sanusi that it was important that he told the truth as the accused was facing a capital charge and assured him that whatever he said could not be used as evidence against him in any proceedings against him.', 'This assurance appeared to have given some comfort to Sanusi.', 'His testimony thereafter was somewhat more enthusiastic although he still appeared somewhat frightened and furtive.', 'Sanusi told the court that at the time of his arrest he was a casual labourer working at a construction site in the Pasir Ris area.', 'He was a heroin addict.', 'For about four to five months prior to his arrest he had been consuming heroin regularly with the accused at that construction site.', 'They consumed heroin by the intravenous method.', 'Whenever erimin was available they would mix erimin with the heroin before injecting.', 'In addition, they would at times also take erimin orally.', 'Sanusi said that, on the morning of 6 July 1994, he and the accused had, as usual, injected themselves with heroin.', 'He could not recall how many straws of heroin had been used but agreed that it could be two straws.', 'Subsequently at the request of the accused, Sanusi accompanied the accused to a pawnshop along Changi Road where the accused bought some jewellery.', 'After that he and the accused were going into the Karachi Restaurant next door when they were both arrested.', 'The accused told the court that he was very poor in his studies and had failed his Primary 6 examinations.', 'He then gave up going to school and started work as a cleaner.', 'He began to consume heroin in 1992 when he was 16 years of age.', 'At the time of his arrest he was an intravenous user of heroin.', 'He would use one two-and-three-quarter inch straw of heroin every two hours or so.', 'When erimin was available he would also consume erimin.', 'He told the court that that morning he had mixed two erimin tablets with the heroin which he and Sanusi had injected intravenously.', 'In addition, he had also taken four erimin tablets orally.', 'He said that because of the drugs he was sleepy and he could remember very little of what happened at the police station.', 'When asked by his counsel if he could recall `even vaguely` that he told Sgt Lai that he intended to sell the drugs, the accused replied that he recalled having said that the heroin was his when the clutch bag and the sachets of heroin were shown to him but beyond that he could not recall what transpired at the station.', 'When the DPP asked whether he knew what he was doing that morning he replied that he could recall going to the goldsmith shop with Sanusi and buying jewellery and he could also remember being arrested at the restaurant next door.', 'An allegation had been made in the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that the accused had not been given any drinks or any lunch prior to the interview with Sgt Lai.', 'There was patently no merit in this suggestion.', 'The accused himself, when giving evidence, made no claim that he had not been given lunch.', 'To the contrary, his evidence was that because he had, since the morning, not injected himself again he had withdrawal symptoms in the lock-up, and was not interested in lunch.', 'He said that he could not take lunch.', 'If he did, he would vomit.', 'Counsel, in his submission at the close of the trial-within-a-trial, did not seek to pursue the suggestion that the accused had not been given food.', 'He conceded that there was no evidence of any inducement, threat or promise but submitted that the court should nevertheless in the exercise of its discretion refuse to admit the conversation between Sgt Lai and the accused as recorded in the pocket book of Sgt Lai.', 'In support of his submission that the court had such a discretion, counsel relied on the case of  PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors    [1990] 1 MLJ 150   .', 'There the trial judges had refused to admit two statements made to the police, one under s 122(6) and one under s 121 because the interpreter used was not sufficiently familiar with the Thai dialect used by that accused.', 'There was in that case no suggestion that there had been any inducement, threat or promise in connection with the two statements.', 'In declining to admit the statements the trial judges had specifically said that they were so doing in the exercise of their discretion.', 'The DPP submitted that there were only three categories of cases where the court could exclude a statement made by an accused person to a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant.', 'These were where there was (1) inducement; (2) threat; or (3) promise emanating from a person in authority in the circumstances described in the proviso to s 122(5).', 'He submitted that other categories such as where there was assault or oppressive conduct were no more than instances of inducement.', 'In such cases the officer by assaulting the accused or by depriving the accused of food or by subjecting the accused to prolonged interrogation was attempting to induce the person to confess.', 'The DPP submitted that outside of the three categories stated in the proviso there was only one situation where the court could exclude a statement.', 'This was where the purported statement was not made by the accused at all.', 'He submitted that   PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors   was such an instance since a statement recorded without proper interpretation could not be said to be a statement made by the accused.', 'I was inclined to agree with the learned DPP that categories such as assault and oppression were no more than instances of inducements or threats.', 'I could not, however, agree with his submission that outside of inducement, threat and promise the only instance when the court could exclude a statement was when the statement was not the statement of the accused.', 'That submission would not sit well with the words used in s 122(5).', 'It is clear from the proviso to s 122(5) that where it appeared that there was inducement, threat or promise the court was obliged to reject and had no discretion to admit the statement.', 'It was only in situations not covered by the proviso that a discretion could be said to exist.', 'The relevant part of s 122(5) reads:    ... any statement made by an accused person ...   shall be admissible  in his trial as evidence ... .', '[Emphasis added.]', 'The words used are `shall be admissible` not `shall be admitted`.', 'On a plain construction of s 122(5) it appeared to me that, where the proviso did not apply, the court was vested with a discretion to admit or reject such statements.', 'The trial judges in   PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors   were doing no more than exercising that discretion.', 'The question that then arose was whether I should, in the circumstances under which the interview between Sgt Lai and the accused was conducted, in the exercise of my discretion, decline to admit the entries in the pocket book made by Sgt Lai and Sgt Lai`s evidence as to what the accused said at the interview.', 'There was a conflict between the evidence of Cpl Rajandran and the evidence of Sgt Lai as to how Sgt Lai had recorded the interview.', 'The conflict may have been resolved if Sgt Lai had kept that piece of paper, but in direct violation of the provisions of the PGO, Sgt Lai had destroyed it.', 'The accuracy with which Sgt Lai transferred what was on the paper to the pocket book, the casual manner in which Sgt Lai undertook this very serious assignment from ASP Lim and the complete disregard that Sgt Lai had for the provisions of s 121 of the CPC and for the very meticulous and carefully drawn up provisions of the PGO all troubled me.', 'I was also troubled by the fact that in seeking to record a statement from an accused person in a capital case Sgt Lai had, in respect of a person whose command of English could not have been good, not taken the elementary precaution of having an interpreter.', 'In view of these irregularities, I felt that it would be prudent to defer a ruling till the end of the case for the prosecution.', 'Sanusi  When the submissions for the trial-within-a-trial ended, Sanusi was recalled for continued cross-examination in the main trial.', 'Sanusi told the court that he started consuming heroin in 1988.', 'At that time he consumed by `chasing the dragon`.', 'He was arrested soon after and placed in the drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) for 21 days.', 'In 1990, he was again arrested and on this occasion detained for 12 months.', 'When released he resumed consuming heroin.', 'As time went by he found that `chasing the dragon` did not give him a sufficient `high` and so he began to take heroin intravenously.', 'Sanusi said that he first met the accused in mid-1993 and they had consumed heroin together intravenously.', 'Thereafter, he met the accused again in early 1994 at the Pasir Ris site where he worked as a labourer.', 'They became good friends and for about four to five months prior to his arrest he consumed heroin together with the accused for four or five days in a week.', 'The heroin was provided by the accused.', 'He also had other sources of supply.', 'He said that when erimin tablets were available, they would mix erimin with the heroin before injection.', 'He would at times also take erimin orally.', 'He told the court that on the morning of 6 July 1994 he had, with the accused, injected a mixture of heroin and erimin.', 'He had also consumed two tablets of erimin orally.', 'Sanusi told the court that he paid the accused for the heroin he consumed.', 'There was no fixed pattern of payment.', 'Sometimes he would pay $10 to $20 each time he consumed, at times he would pay $45 for a 1/2 sachet, at times he would hand to the accused larger sums of money to assist in the purchase of heroin and at times he would not pay immediately but would pay the accused when he had money available.', 'He told the court that as a casual labourer he earned $60 per day most of which he used for the consumption of heroin.', 'Sanusi agreed that there was no security at the construction site where he and the accused stayed.', 'There were many workers living there.', 'There was no cupboard or locker available to either of them to keep their valuables secure.', 'Sanusi said that he was himself not aware that on the morning of 6 July 1994 the accused had 24 sachets of heroin in his clutch bag but he agreed that it would be unsafe for the accused to leave the heroin at the site when leaving the site.', 'Sanusi told the court that after his arrest on 6 July 1994 he was sent to Sembawang DRC.', 'He has been in detention at the DRC since then.', 'When shown his DRC clinical sheet (D7), Sanusi agreed that at the DRC he had denied being an intravenous user.', 'He said that no one at the DRC had examined his arms or legs.', 'If anyone had, they would have seen the intravenous scars.', 'Handphone, pager and other items  When the accused was arrested, besides the 24 sachets of heroin, he had $3,026.28 in cash, a handphone and a pager and he was wearing various gold ornaments.', 'He also had with him a diary cover in which there were several documents.', 'Amongst the documents was an invoice dated 10 June 1994 from the firm that had sold the handphone found in the clutch bag.', 'The invoice showed the purchaser to be one Marhaffis bin Mohamad (Marhaffis).', 'Marhaffis testified that he had on 10 June 1994 bought the handphone on behalf of the accused as the accused did not have his identity card.', 'Apparently to purchase a handphone the purchaser has to produce his identity card.', 'Also in the diary was a licence in respect of handphone No 8269776.', 'The licence was valid for one year and was effective from 13 June 1994.', 'Sanusi testified that the pager found on the accused belonged to his brother.', 'As his brother was not using the pager, he (Sanusi) had about one week prior to their arrest lent the pager to the accused.', 'There were arrears of Telecom charges on the pager.', 'These were paid by the accused.', 'A Telecom bill dated 27 May 1994 for an overdue amount of $164 found in the `diary` of the accused showed that this overdue amount was paid on 5 July 1994.', 'The s 122(6) statement  Insp Chow told the court that he was not told, when the accused was handed to him by Cpl Rajandran, that the accused was an addict.', 'He also did not see the accused suffering from any withdrawal symptoms.', 'To him the accused looked normal.', 'The same evening he referred the accused for a medical examination.', 'He said that he did so as a matter of routine prior to recording a s 122(6) statement, to ensure that there was no injury on the accused and in order to ensure that the accused was not high on drugs or suffering from drug withdrawal.', 'Insp Chow agreed that to refer the accused for a medical examination he had to fill up a form.', 'When asked to produce a copy of that form, Insp Chow protested that it was a confidential document and that he did not know if he was allowed to produce it.', 'I overruled this protest and ordered that the form be produced.', 'Insp Chow`s evidence thereafter was a little flustered.', 'He said that in the form he would not specify those things (meaning whether the accused was high on drugs) and that if it were a withdrawal case the hospital would as a matter of routine refer the prisoner straight to Changi Prison Hospital.', 'He then looked at the form, which he had with him, and told the court that in the form he had asked (only) for a pre-statement medical check-up.', 'The form was then produced (D3).', 'In the form, there were a number of columns describing the type of medical examination required.', 'One of these columns was `Drug Intoxication`.', 'This column had not been ticked.', 'Insp Chow was asked why he had told the court that he had requested the doctor to examine the accused for drug withdrawal when the form did not indicate so.', 'He said he made a mistake.', 'When asked why he claimed the form was confidential, he said that the form said so.', 'There was no such statement on the form.', 'At about 7.30pm Insp Chow, with the assistance of a Malay interpreter, recorded a statement from the accused under the provisions of s 122(6) of the CPC.', 'In the statement the accused in answer to the charge that he had that morning at the Karachi Restaurant been trafficking in diamorphine had said: `All the heroin are mine.` The prosecution did not want this statement to be admitted but at the request of the defence it was admitted in evidence as a defence exhibit.', 'Raid on the accused`s residence  Insp Chow confirmed that that evening, at his request, the accused had led Insp Chow and a party of CNB officers to his mother`s house where a search was conducted.', 'Insp Chow had not, on the day of the arrest or at any other time, gone to the Pasir Ris construction site.', 'When asked why he had not done so, Insp Chow said that the accused had refused to take him there.', 'There was no mention of such a refusal in the long statement recorded from the accused, nor was Insp Chow`s pocket book produced to show that he had made an entry noting the accused`s refusal.', 'Insp Chow was asked why, if the accused had refused, he had not asked Sanusi to take him to the Pasir Ris site.', 'Insp Chow replied that he first saw Sanusi only on 15 August 1994.', 'He saw Sanusi again only when he accompanied the DPP to see Sanusi at the DRC about a week before this hearing started.', 'Second trial-within-a-trial  Insp Chow had on 8 and 9 July 1994, with the assistance of a Malay interpreter, recorded a statement from the accused (long statement).', 'The DPP told the court that he had deleted from this long statement matters that were prejudicial or irrelevant to this trial and was seeking to admit this edited statement in evidence.', 'Defence counsel objected.', 'Counsel was of the view that there was material in the edited statement that was still irrelevant and highly prejudicial and drew the attention of the court to the comments of Yong Pung How CJ in  Wong Kim Poh v PP     [1992] 1 SLR 289   that prosecutors should ensure that irrelevant and prejudicial evidence contained in police statements are not admitted in evidence.', 'In the course of the trial-within-a-trial the DPP made further deletions to the long statement whereupon the defence withdrew its objections and the re-edited long statement (P31A and P31B) was admitted in evidence.', 'In the long statement the accused gave a history of how he became a drug addict in mid-1992, how he graduated to consuming heroin by the intravenous method in mid-1993, of his arrest and detention at the DRC in end-1992 (sic), of his release on a supervision order, of his failure to report for tests thereafter as required, of his stay at Pasir Ris construction site where he worked as a labourer, of his consuming six to seven straws of heroin a day by that time, of his proceeding with his friend `Ochi` after having consumed a straw of heroin to a pawnshop to buy gold and of their arrest at the Karachi Restaurant next door.', 'In this statement the accused mentioned that besides the heroin he had two slabs of erimin tablets in the clutch bag that he had with him that day.', 'Accused`s drug history  Insp Chow had with him the CNB record of the accused.', 'The defence called for its production.', 'The record revealed that prior to 6 July 1994 the accused had been arrested on two previous occasions and sent to the DRC.', 'The first occasion was on 12 March 1992 and the second time was 4 January 1994.', 'The record showed that on the second occasion he was after one week placed on a supervision order for 24 months.', 'This meant he had to report regularly for urine tests.', 'Although Insp Chow knew that the accused was on record as a drug addict, he had not, as part of his investigations, verified with the DRC the extent of the accused`s past addiction to drugs.', 'He did so only in the course of the hearing on the instructions of the DPP.', 'When asked by the defence to produce the medical reports on the accused that he had obtained from the DRC, Insp Chow produced a report by one Dr Abdul Malik of the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre dated 6 January 1994.', 'In the report Dr Malik stated:    I detected sufficient clinical evidence of drug withdrawal syndrome consistent with addiction to opiates.', 'In my opinion he is presently mildly addicted to heroin.', 'Insp Chow had not obtained the medical report on Sanusi when Sanusi was admitted to the DRC on 7 July 1994.', 'DSS analysis  The 24 sachets suspected to be heroin were sent to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) for analysis.', 'They were found to contain no less than 28.36g of diamorphine.', 'A sample of the accused`s urine had also been obtained on 6 July 1994.', 'That was also sent for analysis.', 'It was found to contain 572 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine.', 'Both the chemists who testified agreed that that was a very high quantity of morphine to be found in a person`s urine.', 'A sample of Sanusi`s urine had also been sent for analysis.', 'It was found to contain 1,167 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine.', 'Dr Abdul Malik  Dr Malik had not been called as a witness at the preliminary inquiry.', 'The learned DPP decided to call him since the history of the accused`s drug consumption was a material issue in this trial.', 'Dr Malik told the court that the accused was first admitted to the DRC on 12 March 1992.', 'He had been admitted again on 4 January 1993.', 'Dr Malik had not examined the accused in March 1992 but in January 1993 he had examined the accused on three successive days after admission.', 'Based on the withdrawal symptoms he noted on those three days and the accused`s statement to the staff nurse as noted in the case sheet (P33) that the accused consumed two to three straws of heroin per day, he put up the medical report referred to earlier.', 'Dr Malik agreed that there was a tendency amongst patients to understate the amount of heroin they consumed in order to try and avoid being detained at the DRC.', 'The classification used by the DRC to describe addiction was mild/moderate/severe in ascending order of severity.', 'Dr Malik told the court that the classification was based on the number and severity of withdrawal symptoms detected on the first three days after the patient is admitted.', 'Dr Malik was of the view that there was a co-relation between the quantity of heroin consumed and the severity of the withdrawal symptoms.', 'In his view less than two straws per day would cause mild withdrawal symptoms, three to five straws per day would cause moderate withdrawal symptoms and more than five straws per day would cause severe withdrawal symptoms.', 'He said that the symptoms would disappear in a few days so that classification would depend on how soon after consumption of heroin the patient was examined.', 'In view of this, he could not be certain that the accused was only a mild addict, he could well be a moderate addict.', 'Dr Malik told the court that urine analysis was a more objective test than looking for physical manifestations of withdrawal symptoms.', 'Dr Malik was then told that the accused`s urine was found to contain 572.7 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine and was asked for his comments on the accused`s state of addiction.', 'Dr Malik declined comment saying this was not within his field of expertise.', 'Dr Malik, led by the learned DPP, told the court that when he examined the accused in January 1994 he did not see any signs of intravenous injection marks on the accused`s arms.', 'He said that he could say this because there was no note in his clinical records to indicate he had seen such marks.', 'In cross-examination, Dr Malik agreed that the absence of a note did not necessarily mean that he had examined the arms and found no intravenous marks.', 'In re-examination, the DPP sought to establish from Dr Malik that he had examined the accused again on 8 January 1994 for asthma and that in the course of that examination, if there were needle marks on the arms, he would have seen them and noted them in his clinical notes.', 'The DPP sought to seek Dr Malik`s confirmation that as there was no such note it meant that there was no such marks.', 'In my view this line of questioning by the DPP was somewhat too robust and I made my displeasure known.', 'Dr Malik perhaps picked up the cue from that.', 'He said that in examining for asthma he does not need to look at the arms and so even if there were intravenous marks on the arms he may not have noticed them.', 'Dr Malik was also the doctor who examined Sanusi when Sanusi was admitted to the DRC on 7 July 1994.', 'After examining Sanusi on 7, 8 and 9 July 1994, Dr Malik certified that he detected sufficient clinical evidence of drug withdrawal consistent with addiction to opiates and he opined that Sanusi was mildly addicted to heroin.', 'From his records, Dr Malik confirmed that Sanusi was first admitted to DRC on 9 July 1988 and released on 30 July 1988.', 'He was admitted again on 20 February 1990 and released on 13 February 1991.', 'He told the court that three relapses indicated that there was a very high chance that Sanusi will not be able to give up drugs.', 'Sanusi, he agreed, was a bad case of drug addiction.', 'When asked why, if that was so, he had described Sanusi in his report as `mildly addicted`, he said that that was based on the physical signs of withdrawal seen on Sanusi when Sanusi was examined.', 'If he had found more signs he would have put `moderate`.', 'When told that the urine sample taken from Sanusi showed the presence of 1,167 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine, Dr Malik said that taking that into account, he would categorize Sanusi as a moderate addict.', 'Dr Malik agreed that classification of drug addiction by reference to withdrawal symptoms was a very subjective method of evaluating the degree of addiction.', 'He agreed that the existence of symptoms would depend on when the doctor sees the patient and also on the doctor`s subjective view of the intensity of the symptoms.', 'To illustrate this Dr Malik told the court that in July 1994 when Sanusi was admitted, another doctor, Dr Richard Wee, had concurrently examined Sanusi on the first three days.', 'Dr Wee had reported that he did not detect sufficient signs of drug withdrawal symptoms and that Sanusi was not an addict.', 'It was never in dispute that Sanusi was an intravenous abuser and that up to 6 July 1994 when he was arrested he had been injecting himself intravenously.', 'Sanusi`s evidence was that there were intravenous scars on his arms and leg.', 'The scars were still visible when Sanusi was examined in court.', 'There was, however, no note in the admission records of Sanusi of any intravenous scars.', 'Dr Malik, when asked if he saw any needle marks on Sanusi`s arms, said that he could not be sure.', 'He said that if he found any positive sign he would record it, but no conclusion could be drawn from the absence of such an entry.', 'This was obviously the correct position.', 'Wong Soon Ann  Wong Soon Ann (Wong) was a staff nurse who had interviewed the accused on 4 January 1994 when the accused was taken to the DRC.', 'Like Dr Malik, Wong was not called as a witness at the preliminary inquiry and was a last minute witness.', 'The DPP called Wong in order to have the contents in the case sheet (P33) referred to by Dr Malik admitted in evidence and to establish that when he examined the accused in January 1994 there were no intravenous scars on the accused`s arms.', 'Wong told the court that as a rule he was the person who took the drug history of a patient before Dr Malik saw the patient.', 'He confirmed that most of the entries on the case sheet (P33) of the accused were made by him.', 'He said that the accused admitted to him that he consumed two to three straws of heroin per day for eight to nine months.', 'The accused denied intravenous abuse.', 'Wong said that he had under `Withdrawal Symptoms` written `cool sensation` because when asked the patient told him that he was feeling chilly.', 'He said that he does not specifically ask a patient if the patient was having nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or other symptoms of drug withdrawal but if the patient tells him he would note it.', 'With Wong the DPP followed the same line of questioning as he had with Dr Malik.', 'In P33 there is a pre-stamped section which reads: I/V Abuse: Yes/Denies.', 'Wong told the court that he would ask the patient if he was an intravenous abuser and note his response accordingly in that column.', 'He said that if he sees signs of intravenous abuse on the patient he would also note that on the form.', 'In answer to the DPP, Wong told the court that since in this case he had not made a note of any intravenous mark it meant that there was no such mark.', 'Wong was invited, in the course of cross-examination, to have a look at the accused`s arms to see for himself whether intravenous marks were present.', 'Wong did so.', 'He was then asked if he would agree that there were four tracks of needle marks.', 'After some hesitation and after having, on invitation, looked at the accused`s arms again, Wong confirmed that that was so.', 'When asked whether such marks were present when he examined the accused on 4 January 1994, Wong said that at that time he did not see the marks.', 'If he did, he would have made a note on P33.', 'Wong went on to say that if the patient denied intravenous use he would look at the patient`s arms.', 'Wong was questioned at length on this aspect of his evidence but he maintained that the absence of a note to the contrary in the case sheet meant that the accused had no needle marks on his arms.', 'Later in his evidence, Wong went even further.', 'He said that he would examine the arms as well as the legs of every patient to see if there are needle marks.', 'He considered this important because intravenous abusers are a high risk group for HIV.', 'First trial-within-a-trial  At the first trial-within-a-trial no expert evidence had been called to testify on the effect of heroin and erimin on a person.', 'At the close of the prosecution case counsel sought leave to call Dr Lim Yun Chin (Dr Lim) to testify as an expert in that trial-within-a-trial.', 'Dr Lim was a consultant psychiatrist in private practice.', 'He had read the accused`s long statement.', 'He had been told that the accused started taking heroin intravenously from mid-1993 and that by March 1994 he required six to seven straws of heroin per day to sustain his craving and was also adding erimin to the heroin before injection and taking erimin orally.', 'Dr Lim also examined the accused and Sanusi in court.', 'Dr Lim told the court that there were intravenous scars on both arms of the accused around the elbow regions as well as on his lower left forearm.', 'He said the scars were visible because of granulations caused by impurities present in street heroin.', 'The granulations could also be caused by erimin mixed with the heroin as erimin is not easily soluble in water.', 'He found a similar amount of scars on the arms of Sanusi.', 'Sanusi also had scars on his right calf muscles.', 'The scars on Sanusi and on the accused were all old scars and Dr Lim said that he would not venture any opinion as to when or over what period of time the scars had occurred.', 'He said that if he had seen the scars at about the time the accused and Sanusi were arrested he would have been able to say whether they were fresh at that time but even then, except for noting the fresh scars, he would not, in respect of scars that had healed, have been able to say over what period of time the scars were caused.', 'Dr Lim told the court that the degree of a person`s addiction to drugs could not be measured by reference to the withdrawal symptoms he suffers from.', 'He said that most general practitioners would use the physical withdrawal symptoms as a guide to the severity of addiction but it was not a reliable guide.', 'Dr Lim told the court that erimin was a potent hypnotic drug and was indicated for persons suffering from insomnia.', 'Erimin in excess of the usual dosage of one tablet per night can cause amnesia.', 'It would also induce excessive drowsiness and clouding of consciousness.', 'This would result in judgment being impaired and the patient having a degree of disorientation.', 'Dr Lim said that when erimin and heroin are combined the effects would not only be additive but would be potentiating.', 'Dr Lim opined that the fact that the accused, in spite of facing so severe a charge, had fallen asleep and had to be awakened at 2pm to give a statement to Sgt Lai suggested that both his mental and physical states, at that stage, were totally under the influence of the drugs he had consumed.', 'He also pointed out that when a person is awakened from sleep he would not become alert immediately.', 'There is a lag period of drowsiness and this would be more severe for a person on drugs especially erimin where the drug activity was still going on.', 'Dr Lim told the court that, given the accused`s drug history, at the time the police awoke the accused in the lock-up, he would have been experiencing the full effects of the erimin.', 'This would mean that at that time he would have been excessively drowsy, his judgment and awareness would be impaired and he could suffer from memory loss.', 'Dr Lim was asked how, if the accused was in fact suffering from cloudiness of the mind as a result of the erimin, he could have taken a taxi to the goldsmith shop, bought some gold jewellery and then gone to the coffeeshop next door.', 'Dr Lim responded that after consuming an excessive dose of erimin the person can be coherent and know what he is doing but if the activity occurs during the peak period of the drug then his alertness would be impaired and there will be difficulty in remembering what happened.', 'Dr Lim was of the view that a person who has not developed tolerance to erimin would feel the effect of the erimin within about 1/2 hour.', 'But where a person has developed tolerance the onset of drowsiness may not occur for some hours.', 'At the stage when the first trial-within-a-trial closed, the only evidence that the accused was a drug addict was the accused`s own evidence and Cpl Rajandran`s evidence that he suspected that the accused was an addict because his gait was unsteady.', 'As against this there was the evidence of Sgt Lai that the accused was normal.', 'At the close of the prosecution case there was considerably more material before me on this issue.', 'The accused`s claim that he was addicted to drugs from 1992 was supported by the fact that in 1992 and in 1994 he had been arrested and sent to the DRC.', 'His claim that he was mixing heroin and erimin and taking the mixture intravenously was supported by the evidence of Sanusi.', 'In addition, the accused in his long statement, recorded only two days after his arrest, had said that there were erimin tablets in the clutch bag he had with him.', 'No tablets were produced in court but that may well be because the erimin tablets had fallen out of the clutch bag together with the paper clips and bits of paper when Cpl Rajandran emptied the clutch bag.', 'Dr Lim`s testimony on the effects of erimin, the effects of heroin and erimin combined and his testimony that erimin causes amnesia was unchallenged but the DPP urged that I reject Dr Lim`s evidence that the accused was suffering from these effects as Dr Lim`s evidence was merely hypothetical - he not having examined the accused at the relevant time.', 'The DPP urged that I accept the evidence of Sgt Lai and Insp Chow that the accused was normal.', 'On the totality of the evidence for the trial-within-a-trial, I accepted the accused`s evidence that he was a drug addict and that on the morning of the 6th he had taken erimin orally and injected himself intravenously with a mixture of heroin and erimin.', 'I accepted Dr Lim`s evidence that if the accused had consumed the heroin and erimin as claimed he would suffer from disorientation, drowsiness and a clouding of consciousness which would have impaired his judgment.', 'Although Dr Lim said that the severity of these effects at any particular point of time could vary and would lie on a continuum between normal alertness and being in a coma, I accepted his evidence that bearing in mind the accused`s drug history, the time at which he injected himself with the mixture and the fact that he was awakened from sleep just prior to the interview, all suggested that the accused would be on the higher end of the continuum rather than the lower end at that time.', 'In the light of Dr Lim`s evidence and my finding that the accused was a drug addict and had in fact consumed heroin and erimin that morning, I accepted the accused`s evidence that he had little or no recall of what transpired between him and Sgt Lai.', 'The learned DPP had submitted that even if the court found that the accused, at the time of the interview with Sgt Lai, was suffering from the effect of heroin and erimin, the court should nevertheless admit the statement in evidence as matters such as the state of his mind at the time he gave the statement and even whether he was sufficiently competent in the English language, bearing in mind the brevity of the statement as it appears in the pocket book, were matters that went toward weight and not admissibility.', 'The DPP drew the attention of the court to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Garnam Singh v PP     [1994] 2 SLR 243   and referred the court in particular to the following passage in the judgment delivered by Karthigesu JA:    With due respect to Prof Lee, his evidence fell far short of demonstrating how the effects of withdrawal from drugs affected the appellant`s medical and psychological condition.', 'We would conceive that, in order for the effects of withdrawal from drugs to affect the drug user`s medical and psychological condition to render any statement he makes to be involuntary,   he must be in a state of near delirium , that is to say, that   his mind did not go with the statements he was making .', '[Emphasis added.]', 'On the strength of that passage the learned DPP submitted that the court should refuse to admit the statement only if the accused was at the relevant time in near delirium.', 'The DPP again highlighted the evidence of Sgt Lai that the accused appeared normal and pointed out that the accused himself had not given evidence of his being in any way delirious but had only said that he had no recollection of what transpired at the interview with Sgt Lai.', 'He also drew attention to the fact that, far from being delirious, the accused that morning had his wits sufficiently around him to take a taxi and go shopping for gold ornaments with Sanusi.', 'Learned counsel for the defence, in his submissions, had referred to a note in   Blackstone on Criminal Practice  where the learned authors under the heading `Exclusion (of Confessions) for Unreliability` had in reference to the case of   R v Miller    [1986] 1 WLR 1191  said that there the Court of Appeal had acknowledged the existence of a discretion to refuse to admit a confession which came from a mind which at the time was possibly irrational and what was said may have been the product of delusions and hallucinations.', 'The DPP submitted that   Miller  `s case referred to in   Blackstone   went no further than   Garnam Singh  `s case.', 'He pointed out that although in   Miller   the statement was made by a person who at that time was possibly in so irrational a state of mind that what he said might have been the product of delusion and hallucination, the court, nevertheless, admitted the statement.', 'He submitted that   Miller  `s case in fact supported his submission that the statement made to Sgt Lai should be admitted.', 'It is true that in   Garnam Singh   the issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the appellant, being a heavy user of drugs, was so affected by the withdrawal from the drugs after arrest that the statement given by him would not have been given voluntarily and was, therefore, inadmissible.', 'But a detailed consideration of that case will show that the appellant had been hospitalized immediately after arrest and had remained in hospital for some five days.', 'It was only after his discharge from hospital that the statement was recorded.', 'The trial judge in admitting the statement had found that when the accused was discharged from hospital he had recovered from the effects of withdrawal.', 'The Court of Appeal accepted that finding of fact and it was in that context that Karthigesu JA made the statement relied on by the DPP.', 'Garnam Singh   was, therefore, a very different situation from the present where on the evidence I accept that the statement was recorded at a time when the effect of the erimin was at peak.', 'On the test referred to by Karthigesu JA that `his mind did not go with the statements he was making` there was in my mind more than a reasonable doubt that that would describe the situation of the accused when he was interviewed by Sgt Lai.', 'In   R v Miller  , the trial judge had admitted the confession of the accused who was known to be a paranoid schizophrenic.', 'The Court of Appeal recognized that the trial judge had a discretion in the matter and the trial judge having admitted the confession the Court of Appeal saw no reason to interfere with that exercise of discretion.', 'This is clear from the commentary in   Blackstone   quoted by counsel.', 'It is also clear from the headnotes in the   Weekly Law Report   which reads:    On appeal against conviction:            Held    , dismissing the appeal, that a trial judge had a discretion to refuse or to admit to evidence a confession which he had been satisfied was a voluntary one but had been made by a person who was possibly in an irrational state of mind and in which what was said might have been the product of delusion and hallucinations (post, p 1200D-E); that, accordingly, where a judge had carefully considered the exercise of that discretion it could not be said that he had erred in admitting such confessions to evidence (post, p 1200F).', 'Garnam Singh`s case   and   Miller`s case  , in my view did not support the learned DPP`s submissions that the statement allegedly made by the accused should be admitted.', 'Both these cases go no further than to establish that where there is no inducement, threat or promise the court has a discretion whether to admit the statement or not.', 'It did not follow from the fact that the statements in those cases had been admitted that the statement in this case should also be admitted.', 'My finding that the accused, at the time that Sgt Lai interviewed him, was not in a fit state to be interviewed, was by itself sufficient for me to rule the statement inadmissible.', 'But there were a number of other factors each of which, in my view, also made it undesirable to admit the statement.', 'I turn to consider these other factors.', 'The accused is a Malay boy who had, some years before his arrest, failed Primary 6, left school and started work as a cleaner.', 'Sgt Lai interviewed him in English without offering him the services of a Malay interpreter.', 'In this Sgt Lai was the odd man out.', 'All other statements by the accused were recorded with the services of a Malay interpreter.', 'Sgt Lai of course maintained that the accused was sufficiently proficient in English but when asked why he had said that the accused had used the word `wanted` and not used the word `intended` as recorded in his pocket book he agreed that the accused`s command of English was not sufficient for him to have used the word `intended`.', 'I was satisfied that although the accused could speak a little bit of English it was of such a low standard that, whilst for the purposes of investigation there can be little objection to Sgt Lai speaking to the accused in English, if the prosecution desired to use the accused`s answers to Sgt Lai as evidence against the accused, a Malay interpreter should have been used.', 'It would, in my view, be unsafe to admit as evidence a statement, short though it is, recorded without proper interpretation.', 'In the courts we are particular that the evidence of a witness should be adduced in a language in which the witness is comfortable in.', 'The same care should be exercised by the police in taking statements from accused persons where those statements are to be used as evidence against the accused.', 'In interviewing the accused, Sgt Lai had made notes on a piece of paper and some four hours later, in writing up his pocket book, had `expanded` the notes and entered them into his pocket book.', 'Sgt Lai had ample time to comply with the provision of s 121 of the CPC and record a proper statement from the accused.', 'He had ample time to read the statement back to the accused, ask the accused to confirm its accuracy and get the accused to sign it.', 'Sgt Lai did nothing of this sort.', 'He flagrantly disregarded the provisions of s 121 of the CPC and the provisions of the PGO.', 'It is also to be noted that in `expanding` what was said by the accused Sgt Lai used words that were not uttered by the accused.', 'I referred to the word `intended` above.', 'It is obvious, looking at the entries in the pocket book, that the accused could also not have used words like `sachets of powdery substance`.', 'The DPP submitted that disregard of the PGO and s 121 of the CPC were irrelevant considerations and that the court should admit the statement regardless.', 'In support of this proposition he quoted the judgment of Yong Pung How CJ, in  Fung Yuk Shing v PP     [1993] 3 SLR 421   at p 425 where the learned Chief Justice in rejecting a submission that an entry in the pocket book transcribed thereon the next day from notes made on a piece of paper should not be admitted in evidence said:    There was no real purpose which the production of the original piece of paper could have served.', 'That piece of paper was never shown to the appellant, nor was it signed by him.', 'Koh was the only person who ever saw that piece of paper.', 'He was the person who made the original notes and who then transcribed them into the pocket book: and he was present in court to testify to this.', 'We did not see how the omission to produce the original piece of paper could have prejudiced the appellant in any way, while Koh was available for cross-examination especially since the appellant himself took the stand to give evidence as to the whole interrogation which contradicted that of Koh`s.', 'Indeed, counsel for the appellant in the court below cross-examined Koh as to his questioning of the appellant and the making of the pocket book entries.', 'At the close of the rather detailed cross-examination, counsel put it to Koh that in fact the questioning session (or `interrogation`) had not taken place as described in the pocket book entries; that in fact Koh had only asked the appellant three questions and that the appellant had not at any stage related to Koh the version of events set down in Koh`s pocket book.', 'All this was denied by Koh and it is clear that the learned judicial commissioner, having had the opportunity to observe both Koh and the appellant in the witness stand, was satisfied as to the veracity and credibility of Koh`s testimony, for (as we noted earlier) he stated: `I accepted his evidence on the interrogation and the pocket book entries to be honest and accurate, if not perfect accounts of the interrogation.`       It is clear from what the Chief Justice said that he was not advocating a carte blanche for police officers and narcotics officers to ignore s 121 and the directions so carefully spelt out in the PGO on the keeping of pocket books.', 'All that the Chief Justice was saying was that on the facts of that case the trial judge could not be faulted for having admitted the statement in evidence as the trial judge was satisfied, in spite of the irregularities that were present, that Koh was a credible witness and the entries in his pocket book were honest and accurate.', 'In the present case, I was not so sanguine about the professionalism of Sgt Lai or the accuracy of his memory or record.', 'His confident assertions in court that he was not required to have a pocket book with him and that it was accepted practice to make entries on pieces of paper and transcribe the entries later into the pocket book were, in my view, untruths.', 'It is beyond belief that a staff sergeant with 16 years experience in the Force would be unaware of the importance of maintaining pocket books properly.', 'In any event, when confronted with the PGO he admitted that he was aware of their contents.', 'There were also glaring differences in Sgt Lai`s evidence and Cpl Rajandran`s evidence.', 'Sgt Lai insisted that the accused was normal and did not show signs of being a drug addict.', 'Cpl Rajandran on the other hand had noted, when he first apprehended the accused, that the accused`s gait was unsteady and he suspected that the accused was a drug addict.', 'Cpl Rajandran also noted that when Sgt Lai interviewed the accused, the accused looked sleepy.', 'Sgt Lai`s evidence was that he had only jotted down points on the piece of paper but Cpl Rajandran`s evidence was that Sgt Lai wrote down the questions asked as well as the answers given.', 'Between the testimony of these two officers, I accepted the evidence of Cpl Rajandran.', 'If Sgt Lai had recorded a statement from the accused on that piece of paper in the form of questions and answers, the question arose why he destroyed the paper.', 'What Sgt Lai should have done in compliance with s 121(2) was to have read back to the accused what he had written and asked the accused to sign on the paper.', 'There was no need to transcribe what was on the paper to his pocket book and destroy the paper.', 'The least Sgt Lai should have done was preserve that piece of paper as an exhibit as required by the PGO.', 'I would here refer to the case of  Kong Weng Chong & Ors v PP     [1994] 1 SLR 34   .', 'In that case the trial judge had admitted in evidence the oral statement of the appellant as recorded in the pocket books of two narcotics officers some time after the statements were made.', 'The attention of the trial judge had not been drawn to that and other irregularities in the manner in which the statement was made and the trial judge in admitting the statement had not considered these irregularities.', 'The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the manner in which the statement had been taken was unsatisfactory and the statements should not have been admitted.', 'I would note here that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not reject the oral statement because of any inducement, threat or promise but rejected the statement in the exercise of the discretion the court had to exclude a statement even when there was no inducement, threat or promise.', 'An oral statement of an accused person would not be rendered inadmissible merely because of non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of s 121.', 'This is now settled law (see:  PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor     [1993] 1 SLR 512   ).', 'There is however good reason why the legislature has in s 121 spelt out the manner in which statements are to be recorded.', 'Similarly, there is good reason why the Commissioner of Police under powers given to him under s 55 of the Police Force Act issued General Orders specifying in lucid detail the manner in which pocket books are to be kept.', 'The fact that s 122(5) provides that oral statements are admissible in evidence should not be treated as licence for police officers to ignore the PGO and the provisions of s 121 and render these safeguards meaningless.', 'Where, as in this case, the violation of these provisions was flagrant, it was incumbent on the prosecution to either offer some reasonable explanation for such violation or desist from attempting to adduce statements taken in disregard of these provisions as evidence before the court.', 'In this context, in fairness to Sgt Lai, it is entirely possible that Sgt Lai did not appreciate, when he interviewed the accused, that the prosecution, at the trial, was going to seek to adduce evidence of his, rather casual, interview.', 'It is important that in conducting a prosecution, the prosecutor should consider carefully the circumstances under which a statement oral or written was made and seek to adduce evidence of that statement only if the circumstances warrant.', 'Failure to observe this principle results in very considerable time being unproductively taken up in conducting trials-within-trials.', 'It would be far better if these energies were directed into a more thorough investigation of the case against the accused.', 'In the light of the effect of the erimin and heroin on the accused, the absence of a Malay interpreter and the irregularities in the way Sgt Lai kept a record of what the accused said, I was of the view that it would be unsafe to admit in evidence what the accused had allegedly told Sgt Lai.', 'In the exercise of my discretion therefore I declined to admit that alleged statement.', 'At the end of the prosecution case the undisputed evidence before the court was that the accused was in possession of the 24 sachets of heroin.', 'The provisions of s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) were therefore triggered and a presumption arose that the accused had the heroin in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.', 'There was in addition the unchallenged evidence of Sanusi that he regularly obtained heroin from the accused.', 'There was clearly a prima facie case against the accused and I therefore called on his defence.', 'The accused elected to give evidence.', 'The defence  The accused was born in November 1974.', 'Soon after he was born his parents separated and he was brought up by his maternal grandparents.', 'Subsequently, his grandmother with whom he was very close died.', 'The accused attended primary school but he was a weak student and left school at the age of 12 when he failed his Primary 6.', 'He then worked as a cleaner until the age of 17 earning about $550 per month.', 'In 1992, he left his cleaning job and began working as a daily paid casual labourer for one Abang Man who had sub-contract work in a number of construction sites.', 'The accused said that he began to consume drugs after he started work as a construction labourer.', 'The accused`s testimony as to how he progressed in the consumption of heroin was more or less what he had told Insp Chow in his long statement except that in the statement he had said that he commenced consuming heroin in mid-1992 but in court when told that the CNB record showed that he was first arrested by the CNB in March 1992 for suspected consumption of heroin, he said that he started consuming drugs a few months before that arrest.', 'The accused said that at the early stage he and a group of friends would share two to three straws of heroin in a day but towards the end of the year he was consuming two to three straws by himself.', 'At that time he was consuming by `chasing the dragon`.', 'By mid-1993 he no longer found satisfaction in chasing the dragon and started consuming heroin by injecting himself intravenously.', 'In referring to his intravenous use of heroin, the accused in para 5 of the long statement had said that he continued to consume heroin intravenously until `end of 1992` when he was arrested by the police for consuming heroin.', 'The accused was arrested by the CNB in January 1994.', 'Quite obviously the reference to `end of 1992` was an error.', 'It should read `end of 1993` and the accused so testified.', 'The DPP however, after consulting with Insp Chow, refused to concede that it was an error.', 'The accused accepted that he was arrested by the CNB on 4 January 1994 for consuming heroin as shown in the CNB records.', 'He was detained for a week and released on condition that he reported regularly at Central Police Station for urine test.', 'He told the court that his craving for heroin was so strong that he was unable to give up taking heroin.', 'He therefore did not report even once for his urine test.', 'He said that about that time he was consuming a minimum of six straws per day.', 'He told the court that he began to mix erimin in the heroin before injecting himself from about February 1994.', 'He did so because the addition of erimin gave a better `kick`.', 'After he was released from the DRC, the accused said he worked for one Abang Man, a sub-contractor, at the Pasir Ris construction site.', 'He also lived at the site.', 'There he met Sanusi.', 'They became good friends and began to consume heroin together.', 'Sanusi lived at the site for four to five days in a week.', 'At weekends Sanusi would not be there.', 'The accused told the court that sometime after starting work at the Pasir Ris site he began to buy heroin by the sachets.', 'He said he found this cheaper and more convenient.', 'Sanusi would contribute money for the purchase.', 'If Sanusi had no money the accused would pay from his own funds first and Sanusi would reimburse the accused for the amounts Sanusi consumed.', 'The accused told the court that when consuming heroin from the sachets he would use straws as a measure.', 'In each straw he would fill an amount that would be between one and two `suku` straws.', 'From one sachet he could get about 12 to 13 such straws.', 'The accused said that he himself consumed about six to seven such straws of heroin per day.', 'He would inject himself every two hours or so and he would consume heroin about six or seven times a day.', 'Sanusi would consume heroin with him three times a day.', 'The accused told the court that the 24 sachets he had with him when he was arrested were for the consumption of Sanusi and himself.', 'He said that he would consume slightly less than one sachet of heroin per day.', 'Their combined consumption he said was about 11/4 to 11/2 sachets per day.', 'The accused said that he and Sanusi would consume all the 24 sachets found on him (22 full and two half sachets) within 14 days.', 'By himself he would consume about 14 to 15 of the sachets in two weeks.', 'The accused told the court that his supplier saw him once in about two to three weeks.', 'The amount supplied by the supplier at each delivery was not fixed.', 'It was normally about 20 sachets.', 'The supplier would arrange the time of delivery.', 'The accused said that he had paged the supplier a few times to get earlier delivery but the supplier had ignored his pager calls and made deliveries only at his (the supplier`s) convenience.', 'The supplier delivered the 24 sachets he had with him on the evening of 5 July 1994.', 'The accused said that on the morning of 6 July 1994 he had taken out two straws of heroin from one of the half packets and after mixing the heroin with erimin had injected himself with the mix.', 'After that he had sealed that half packet by placing the cut end between a pair of chopsticks and burning the ends together.', 'The investigating officer had not weighed each packet individually or required the DSS to do so.', 'There was therefore no evidence before the court as to the weight of the two half packets.', 'If they had been weighed individually, the weights may have been useful in assessing whether the accused`s claim to have consumed some of the heroin from one of the half sachets was true or not.', 'The learned DPP tried to establish that the seals on the two half sachets were identical and the accused`s claim that he resealed the half packet was untenable.', 'Looking at the two half sachets, I was not able to accept that the sachet could not have been resealed by the accused in the manner demonstrated by the accused.', 'The accused confirmed that Marhaffis bought the handphone for him on 10 June 1994.', 'He said that he had no identity card and so was unable to buy the handphone himself.', 'He obtained the handphone because at the Pasir Ris site there was no telephone service and he found it a chore to go out to use a phone.', 'The accused confirmed that he had borrowed the pager from Sanusi about one week prior to his arrest.', 'He said it would be easier for the supplier to contact him to arrange delivery if he had a pager.', 'He told the court that when he borrowed the pager the Telecom bill on the pager had not been paid for a while.', 'On 5 July 1994, the day before his arrest, he settled the outstanding bill to make the pager useable.', 'The accused had $3,026 in cash when he was arrested.', 'He also had about $1,300 worth of jewellery on his person including a bangle and two rings that he had purchased that morning at the Lian Thye Pawnshop.', 'When asked to explain how he had so much cash and jewellery on him he stated that on 5 July 1994 he and the other workers were paid their salary.', 'This was between $1,100 and $1,300.', 'The workers had gambled that night and he won $1,000 plus in the gambling.', 'The rest of the money was his savings.', 'He said that he buys gold as an investment.', 'When short of money he would pawn the gold.', 'The accused told the court that at the Pasir Ris site he had no secure place in which to store his valuables.', 'It was therefore his practice to always carry with him all cash and other valuables wherever he went.', 'That was why, on the morning of 6 July 1994, when he went to the Lian Thye Pawnshop to buy jewellery he had with him the 24 sachets of heroin, the cash, the handphone and the pager.', 'The accused denied that he had the 24 sachets with him in order to deliver the 24 sachets or any part of them to anyone.', 'In cross-examination, the learned DPP spent considerable time trying to establish that the accused was not working at the construction site.', 'The only basis for the DPP`s cross-examination was the initial testimony of Sanusi when Sanusi started to give evidence that he did not know if the accused worked at the construction site.', 'As noted earlier, Sanusi at that early stage appeared nervous and frightened.', 'Not only did he at that time say that he did not know if the accused worked at the Pasir Ris construction site, he also said that he himself was not working at that site.', 'In his subsequent evidence, however, he freely affirmed that he was himself a casual labourer at that site and although he may not have expressly said so, the tenor of his evidence was that the accused was also working at the said site.', 'The DPP also spent a number of days cross-examining the accused with a view to establishing that the accused was only a mild and not a severe addict.', 'The accused had not been medically examined for drug addiction at any time after his arrest.', 'There was therefore no medical evidence of the extent of the accused`s drug addiction at the time of his arrest.', 'For the purposes of cross-examination, the DPP only had the evidence of Sgt Lai and Insp Chow that the accused appeared normal to them when they interviewed him and the evidence of Dr Malik and nurse Wong that he was only a mild/moderate addict seven months prior to 6 July 1994.', 'In the light of the evidence given by Dr Lim Yun Chin and the prosecution`s own expert Dr Leow Kee Fong that I will hereafter refer to, I do not need to try and summarize this lengthy cross-examination.', 'It will suffice to say that throughout the cross-examination the accused maintained what he had told Insp Chow in the long statement and what he had said in evidence-in-chief.', 'The accused agreed that he told the nurse at the DRC in January 1994 that he was not an intravenous user and that he was consuming only three to four straws a day but added that he said that in order to avoid a detention order.', 'In the event the accused was in fact not detained.', 'The accused also told the court that he did not recall anyone at the DRC examining his arms for needle marks.', 'Towards the end of his cross-examination the learned DPP wanted a description from the accused of the withdrawal symptoms the accused suffered from in the days following his arrest on 6 July 1994.', 'The DPP told the court that he wanted to know this because, based on the withdrawal symptoms, an expert witness whom the DPP had on standby, would in rebuttal be able to say what kind of addict the accused was.', 'I told the DPP that if it was possible to say from the withdrawal symptoms what the extent of addiction was, the accused should have been medically examined for such symptoms at the time of arrest.', 'To ask the accused now to state from memory what his medical symptoms then were did not appear to be the right way of doing things.', 'The DPP, however, persisted.', 'The accused, on being prodded for answers, said that in the days following the arrest he suffered from diarrhoea, vomiting, running nose, chill, ache, tears in his eyes, weakness, frequent yawning, sleepiness and the craving for heroin.', 'Dr Lim Yun Chin  Dr Lim, who had testified earlier in the first trial-within-a-trial was again called by the defence to give evidence as an expert on drug addiction.', 'His credentials were impressive.', 'Besides his basic degree in medicine obtained in 1976, Dr Lim had a Diploma in Psychological Medicine in 1982 awarded by the Royal College of Physicians in England, a Master of Medicine in Psychiatry awarded in Singapore in 1986 and was admitted as a Fellow of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, in 1988.', 'From 1980 to 1982 he had worked at two specialist hospitals in England where he had `hands on` experience in the field of drug and alcohol addiction.', 'From 1983 to 1989 he was psychiatrist to various Drug Rehabilitation Centres in Singapore where he had contact with drug addicts at different stages of their addiction including acute withdrawal as well as post-withdrawal states.', 'From 1988 to 1989 he was the Prison (Forensic) Psychiatrist in Changi Prison Hospital where he also had clinical experience with drug addicts.', 'From 1989 to 1990, he was attached to the University of Minnesota Drug Dependency Department as an International Fellow.', 'There he had clinical experience in alcohol and drug addiction including the assessment and treatment of heroin withdrawal.', 'He has lectured on drug addiction to candidates sitting for their Master of Medicine degree in Psychiatry exams as well as the Master of Science degree in Public Health, both organized by the School of Post-Graduate Medical Studies in Singapore.', 'In private practice he now deals with patients having drug and alcohol problems.', 'He is a voluntary worker in Siloam Centre, a halfway house for drug addicts, where he interacts with addicts in different stages of their recovery.', 'I have set out the credentials of Dr Lim in fair detail because the DPP, in his cross-examination, questioned the sufficiency of Dr Lim`s expertise with drug addicts undergoing withdrawal and disputed a number of his professional views.', 'Dr Lim told the court that when defence counsel consulted him on this case in late February 1995 he was given a copy of the accused`s long statement to the police.', 'In addition, counsel kept him informed of evidence adduced at the trial relevant to the question of the accused`s addiction to drugs.', 'Dr Lim gave his opinion in a written report which read as follows:    Based on the information available to me, I am of the opinion that Dahlan bin Ladaewa suffered from a severe form of drug addiction at the time of his arrest.', 'The extent of his severity was reflected in his evolving pattern of heroin consumption, namely, graduating from `chasing the dragon` to that of   intravenous  injection.', 'The severity of his addiction is of such magnitude that he needed the sudden effect (rush) of heroin, that could effectively be obtained from IV injection, plus the potentiating effect of   Erimin , a very potent   hypnotic  drug to produce the desired effect.', 'Being severely addicted meant that he required increasing quantity of heroin to produce the desired effect.', 'This is due to a physiological phenomenon known as   tolerance  .', 'I was informed by the defence that from March 1994 onwards the accused was taking between six to ten straws of heroin mixed with Erimin pills every day.', 'The 24 sachets found on him on 6 July 1994 was meant for his and Sanusi`s consumption.', 'Sanusi would be with Dahalan four to five days in a week to consume drugs.', 'Dahalan would consume about one to two straws per session up to six sessions per day.', 'In the case of Sanusi he consumes about three times a day in the company of Dahalan.', 'Two to three straws were used when they consumed together.', 'Based on the pattern of consumption described aforesaid, it is conceivable that the accused would have no difficulty consuming the 24 packets in 14 days.', '...', 'I had the opportunity of examining the accused Dahalan bin Ladaewa [and Sanusi] in the High Court on the 23 March 1995 and confirmed the existence of four `tracks` in his arms.', 'This `tracks` would be compatible with old scars produced by IV injections of heroin or heroin mixed with fine particles of Erimin pills.', '... Dr Lim, at the trial-within-a-trial, had testified that, based on the accused`s drug history, the accused was a severe addict.', 'He had also testified that there was no necessary co-relation between the severity of the withdrawal symptoms and the degree of addiction.', 'Dr Lim repeated that evidence in the main trial.', 'He added that to his knowledge no research had been conducted and no scientific papers published that established a link between the severity of addiction and the severity of withdrawal.', 'His own experience he said was that there was no such link.', 'He told the court that even with people with similar drug histories the severity of each individual`s withdrawal symptoms could vary.', 'He has also personally come across one case where the same patient taking the same amount of drugs had different degrees of withdrawal on the two occasions that he examined the patient.', 'He told the court that a host of variable factors such as health, physical constitution, mental state and tolerance to the withdrawal symptoms itself contribute to the nature of withdrawal symptoms of an addict.', 'Age, Dr Lim said, was also a factor.', 'Older people would find withdrawal more distressing than younger people.', 'He told the court that a patient can even be suffering from severe withdrawal without overtly appearing to be in agony.', 'Dr Lim told the court that, in his view, at the DRC when a patient was assessed as mild, moderate or severe what was really being assessed was not the degree of his addiction but the degree of the withdrawal symptoms that was noticed on the patient when examined.', 'Dr Malik had testified that the amount of morphine found in the urine of a patient was a more objective test of the severity of addiction than observation of withdrawal symptoms.', 'Dr Lim would not endorse that view.', 'He told the court that it had not been established by scientific study that there was any co-relation between the amount of heroin consumed and the amount of morphine in the urine.', 'He said that a person may take a very small amount of heroin and yet have a large amount of morphine in his urine and vice versa.', 'The amount of morphine in the urine, he said, would depend on the patient`s individual metabolism and other factors.', 'Dr Lim told the court that the fact that a heroin abuser begins to take heroin intravenously is in itself evidence that he had become a severe addict.', 'In his view, an addict who graduates to the intravenous method does so because he has developed so great a tolerance to heroin that consuming heroin by `chasing the dragon` was no longer sufficient for him.', 'The learned DPP suggested to Dr Lim that taking heroin intravenously was no more than a method of consuming heroin.', 'Dr Lim disagreed.', 'He told the court that an addict would switch to intravenous consumption of heroin because his tolerance for heroin had grown to such an extent that ordinary consumption was not enough.', 'He needed the extra `kick` of the intravenous method.', 'Such a switch, in Dr Lim`s view, indicated an exponential increase in the tolerance to heroin of the addict.', 'He told the court that there were very few cases in Singapore where addicts had switched to intravenous consumption.', 'Dr Lim also disagreed with a further suggestion by the DPP that when an addict switches to intravenous use he would in fact consume less heroin.', 'The DPP asked Dr Lim whether he had found that heroin addicts have a tendency not to allow their addictions to increase too rapidly.', 'Dr Lim replied that addicts were unable to control their need for the heroin.', 'They cannot also control their need for more and more heroin as their tolerance to heroin grew.', 'That was why they are termed `addicts`.', 'Dr Lim said that scars caused by intravenous injections would, with time, fade.', 'As the scars on the accused`s arms were old he was not able to say, by now looking at the scars, for how long or how frequently the accused had been injecting himself at the time of his arrest.', 'He was however prepared to say from the remnants of the scars that the accused had a history of injecting himself fairly regularly.', 'The total amount of diamorphine in the 24 sachets was 28.36g.', 'Each sachet had not been weighed or analysed separately but taking it on average each full sachet in this case would contain about 1.2g of diamorphine.', 'Dr Lim testified that intravenous abusers would have developed a high tolerance to heroin and it is possible that they can inject themselves even with 1g of heroin in a single dose without serious effects.', 'Dr Lim was of the view that given the accused`s profile, the accused`s claim that he was consuming between half and one sachet in a day was believable.', 'Evidence in rebuttal - Dr Leow Kee Fong  After Dr Lim had testified, the prosecution applied for leave to call Dr Leow Kee Fong, the Registrar of Changi Prison Hospital, as an expert witness to rebut the evidence of Dr Lim.', 'In making this application, the DPP informed the court that through Dr Leow he would rebut the evidence of Dr Lim that:     (a) there was no co-relation between the degree of severity of drug withdrawal and the degree of severity of drug addiction;    (b) when an addict switches to intravenous injection it indicates an exponential increase in rate of consumption;    (c) addicts are not able to exercise control over their consumption rate; and through Dr Leow he would establish that the accused was not as severe an addict as the defence had claimed.', 'I granted leave for Dr Leow to be called.', 'Dr Leow obtained his medical qualification (MBBS) from the University of Singapore in 1979.', 'He joined government service and has been in service since.', 'From 1988, he has been attached to Drug Rehabilitation Centres in Singapore.', 'In 1992, he was appointed Registrar of Changi Prison Hospital but continued to work with drug addicts at the drug rehabilitation centre at Jalan Awan.', 'Prior to 1988, he had worked at a drug rehabilitation centre for a year in 1981.', 'Dr Leow was the immediate supervisor of Dr Malik.', 'On (a), Dr Leow agreed with Dr Lim that there was no necessary co-relation between the amount of drugs consumed and withdrawal symptoms seen in an addict.', 'He agreed that the severity of withdrawal symptoms could vary amongst persons consuming the same amount of heroin.', 'Dr Leow, however, told the court that his experience was that as the same person consumed more and more heroin that person`s withdrawal symptoms progressively became more and more severe.', 'Dr Leow told the court that whether withdrawal symptoms are detected and when detected the assessment of their severity would depend on the astuteness of the doctor examining the addict for signs and on how accurately the addict describes his symptoms to the doctor.', 'He said that at the DRC there were no facilities for monitoring an addict on a continuing basis and so the doctors rely mainly on the signs they detect and on the addict`s description of his symptoms.', 'Dr Leow agreed that categorization of drug addicts in terms of the severity of their withdrawal symptoms was a difficult exercise that depended very much on the subjective view of the doctor on the signs he sees on the patient and the accuracy with which the patient describes his symptoms to the doctor.', 'Dr Leow said that except in very severe cases of withdrawal, it was possible for different doctors to classify an addict differently.', 'On (b), whilst Dr Leow did not say that switching to intravenous injection indicates an exponential increase in the rate of consumption, he did say that an addict who switches from chasing the dragon to intravenous injection may not immediately increase the amount of heroin he uses, but, thereafter, as tolerance continues to grow, he will gradually increase his consumption of heroin.', 'He said that there can be no hard and fast rules as to the rate at which tolerance grows.', 'On (c), Dr Leow told the court that if drugs were available the addict would consume what he needs.', 'He agreed with Dr Lim that if the supply was available, an addict will not be able to exercise control over his consumption rate.', 'The DPP did not proceed to adduce any evidence from Dr Leow that the accused was not as severe an addict as the accused claimed.', 'To the contrary, Dr Leow told the court that he would classify a consistent intravenous user of heroin as a severe addict.', 'When Dr Leow said that, I suggested to Dr Leow that he should have a look at the accused`s arms.', 'Dr Leow did so.', 'He then told the court that from the remaining scars that he saw on the accused`s arms he would say that the accused had not been an occasional intravenous user but had been taking drugs intravenously for some time.', 'He said that the marks still remaining on the accused`s arms indicated that the accused was a chronic intravenous abuser.', 'Dr Leow further told the court that there were very few cases of chronic intravenous abuse in Singapore.', 'Throughout his career he had come across only about 10 to 20 such cases.', 'Dr Leow agreed that it was possible for a severe addict to consume one sachet of heroin daily.', 'He added that he would expect a person consuming such a large amount of heroin to develop severe withdrawal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, chill, running nose and tearing of the eyes.', 'He added that given the history of the accused he would have expected severe withdrawal symptoms after his arrest.', 'Such a person, he said, should have been admitted to hospital.', 'In cross-examination, Dr Leow was asked to read Dr Lim`s report.', 'He did so in court and said that he agreed with the report.', 'Findings  Having heard the evidence of Dr Lim and Dr Leow, I had no doubt that the accused was a very severe addict.', 'I accepted Dr Lim`s evidence that when an addict becomes a regular intravenous user it indicates that his tolerance levels were so high that he could no longer get satisfaction from chasing the dragon.', 'In this case, I was satisfied that the accused was not only an intravenous abuser but a chronic intravenous abuser.', 'Notwithstanding the evidence of nurse Wong (which in any event I disbelieved) I found that the accused had been an intravenous abuser from mid-1993.', 'The evidence of Dr Lim and Dr Leow was that even after an addict switches to intravenous consumption his tolerance will continue to grow.', 'That being so, by July 1994 the accused`s tolerance to heroin and therefore his consumption of heroin would have been substantial.', 'The accused`s evidence that he was consuming nearly one sachet of heroin per day was therefore entirely plausible and I accepted that evidence.', 'I also accepted the evidence of Dr Leow that given the accused`s history of addiction he would, after his arrest, have suffered severe withdrawal.', 'This was exactly what the accused claimed.', 'I rejected Insp Chow`s claim that the accused, after his arrest, was normal and not suffering from withdrawal.', 'This trial had taken more than 20 days.', 'The reason it was so protracted was because the prosecution, relying on the evidence of Insp Chow, Dr Malik and nurse Wong, had doggedly tried to demonstrate that the accused was only a mild addict and hence liable for the death sentence as the amount of diamorphine contained in the 24 sachets that he was trafficking in, would exceed 15g.', 'Dr Leow was the prosecution`s own witness.', 'In the light of his testimony, it was a complete waste of time for the prosecution to have tried to show that the accused was only a mild addict.', 'If the investigating officer had, immediately after the arrest, referred the accused to a hospital, and a doctor with the competence of Dr Leow had examined the accused, it would have been established right from the start that the accused was a chronic intravenous abuser.', 'It is simply not enough, in respect of a drug addict, for the prosecution to rely on the evidence of an investigating officer that an accused person appeared normal as evidence that the accused was not a severe addict.', 'An the investigating officer is not a medical officer and cannot be relied upon to assess the medical condition of an accused.', 'It is very important, especially when drug addicts in possession of relatively small quantities of heroin are charged with trafficking, that a full medical examination for drug addiction is conducted as soon as possible after arrest.', 'This is all the more important where the prosecution takes the view that the severity of drug addiction can be measured by the severity of withdrawal symptoms.', 'Withdrawal symptoms last for a relatively short time.', 'If the symptoms are not immediately monitored, then that evidence is lost and this could be highly prejudicial to the defence.', 'There is also the danger of intravenous scars disappearing with time.', 'In the present case, it was fortuitous for the accused that at the time of his trial there were still sufficient scars visible on his arms for Dr Lim and Dr Leow to say that he had been a chronic intravenous abuser.', 'It was also fortuitous that the DPP called Dr Leow as a `rebuttal` witness!', 'The difficulty in trying to equate severity of addiction with the severity of withdrawal symptoms was vividly illustrated in this case in connection with the medical examination of Sanusi at the DRC soon after Sanusi was arrested.', 'On the basis of the withdrawal symptoms he noted, Dr Malik certified Sanusi to be a mild addict and in court added that Sanusi could be a moderate addict.', 'Dr Wee, who examined Sanusi at about the same time, found that Sanusi was not an addict at all.', 'To make matters more complicated, on Dr Leow`s evidence, in view of the intravenous marks on Sanusi`s arms being as severe as those on the accused`s, Sanusi would be a severe addict!', 'The prosecution had sought to establish, through Dr Malik and through Dr Leow, that the severity of drug addiction can be measured by the severity of the drug withdrawal symptoms.', 'Dr Lim rejected this proposition summarily.', 'Dr Leow also did not quite support that proposition.', 'In the light of their evidence, and in the light of the conflicting views on the severity of Sanusi`s addiction when it was indisputable that Sanusi was a severe addict, there is considerable doubt in my mind whether the position adopted by the prosecution that the severity of drug addiction can be determined by reference to the severity of the withdrawal is a sound one.', 'It seems to me, that the categorization at the DRC is no more than a categorization of the withdrawal symptoms noted.', 'In spite of the very clear evidence of Dr Lim and Dr Leow that the accused was a severe addict and hence quite capable of consuming about one sachet of heroin per day, the learned DPP, in his lengthy closing submissions, nevertheless proceeded to explore all the evidence adduced in the greatest of detail in an effort to show that the accused could not be consuming the amounts of heroin he said he was.', 'It was only with difficulty and even then only towards the close of his submissions that I managed to get him to see that in the light of the evidence of his own expert, he would have to approach the case not on the basis of the evidence of Dr Malik, nurse Wong, Sgt Lai and Insp Chow but on the basis that the accused was in fact a severe addict who could well have been consuming about a sachet of heroin per day.', 'Once the DPP abandoned the limited approach that he had for so long pursued, his submissions became very much more effective.', 'I need here to deal only with that part of his submission.', 'The DPP submitted that accepting that the accused was a severe addict consuming between half and one sachet per day of heroin, the court had to consider two points:     (a) how that consumption rate related to the rate at which the accused was purchasing drugs; and    (b) how the accused was able to afford such an expensive habit based on his evidence of his income and savings.', 'On (a), the learned DPP submitted that if, for example, the accused had been purchasing drugs once every three to four days but the quantity he purchased on each occasion was sufficient to last him (say) 20 days, the accused would have to give a satisfactory explanation as to what he was doing with the excess drugs that he was purchasing.', 'The consumption rate had, therefore, to be looked at in relation to the purchasing rate.', 'The DPP pointed out that although the accused had claimed that the supplier made deliveries once in two to three weeks, the accused had also said that if he wanted supplies earlier he would page the supplier.', 'The DPP submitted that this indicated that two to three weeks was not necessarily a fixed time-frame for the delivery of supplies.', 'On (b), the learned DPP submitted that accepting that the accused was consuming one sachet a day the cost per month of heroin that he was personally consuming (based on the accused`s evidence that he paid about $90 per sachet) would be about $2,500.', 'On the accused`s evidence, his income from his work would at most be $1,700 per month.', 'How, asked the DPP, could the accused afford this expensive lifestyle?', 'And not only that, when he was arrested he had about $3,000 in cash and $2,000 worth of jewellery.', 'Besides, why would the accused need a handphone and a pager?', 'All this, in the DPP`s submission, led to the conclusion that the accused was not a mere consumer of the heroin found on him: he was a trafficker.', 'I will deal first with the question whether the accused was trafficking in heroin before going into the next question whether in respect of the 24 sachets found on him he was trafficking in more than 15g of diamorphine.', 'The amount of cash found on the accused (not to mention the jewellery) suggested that the accused had a source of income over and above his earnings as a casual labourer.', 'The purchase of the handphone on 10 June 1994 and the fact that the accused on the day before his arrest had paid up the arrears on the pager belonging to Sanusi`s brother in order to be able to make use of that pager were also matters that aroused suspicion.', 'It does not seem very likely that a casual labourer with the background of the accused would have purchased a handphone and obtained a pager if he was a mere consumer of heroin.', 'It was, therefore, likely that besides supplying Sanusi the accused had been trafficking in heroin.', 'That would explain the cash and the jewellery found on him and provide an explanation as to how, on his income as a casual labourer, he was able to finance his need for heroin.', 'But the charge that the accused faced before me was not whether prior to 6 July 1994 the accused had been trafficking in heroin and, if so, in what amounts but whether the accused was trafficking in respect of the 24 sachets of heroin he had with him at the Karachi Restaurant on the morning of 6 July 1994.', 'In deciding this issue, any previous criminal conduct of the accused would be irrelevant and I obviously could not allow my mind to be influenced by such conduct.', 'As learned counsel for the accused pointed out, if the prosecution sought to prove that the accused had been a trafficker in drugs during the period he was staying at the Pasir Ris construction site, it was open to the prosecution to have framed such a charge.', 'The accused admitted that from the 24 sachets he would be supplying heroin to Sanusi.', 'It was in evidence that Sanusi would pay the accused for the heroin he consumed.', 'The presumption that the accused was trafficking in the heroin found in his possession that morning was clearly not rebutted.', 'I therefore turn to address the question whether, in view of the accused himself being an addict, the accused was trafficking in more than 15g out of the 28.36g of diamorphine contained in the 24 sachets.', 'It was not disputed that the burden again was on the accused to show, on the balance of probabilities, that he was trafficking in 15g or less of the diamorphine contained in the 24 sachets and that the rest was for his personal consumption.', 'I accepted the DPP`s submission that the amount of diamorphine that would be consumed by the accused from the 24 sachets should be looked at in connection with the frequency of supply.', 'The DPP highlighted the fact that the accused had said that when he wanted supplies earlier than the two to three weeks he had paged the supplier.', 'That statement by the accused, however, was only one aspect of what the accused said.', 'Having said that he went on to say that it was the supplier who determined when the supply was to be delivered and he was not successful in trying to influence the supplier into making earlier delivery.', 'A supplier of a commodity like heroin is likely to be most cautious in making deliveries and would want to limit deliveries to as few occasions as possible.', 'I accepted the evidence that the supplier would make deliveries to the accused once in about two weeks.', 'The next question that arose was whether the last occasion that the supplier effected delivery was in fact on 5 July 1994.', 'The supplier could conceivably have effected delivery long before that.', 'If that be so, the next delivery might be imminent and only an insignificant part of the 24 sachets would have been for the accused`s own consumption.', 'The only evidence before the court on this issue was the evidence of the accused.', 'It would be unrealistic to expect corroboration of the time of delivery.', 'Such deliveries are, by their very nature, secretive.', 'On balance, I accepted the evidence of the accused that the 24 sachets were delivered on 5 July 1994.', 'For any addict, the amount of heroin consumed in a day would depend on factors such as availability, company, mood and opportunity.', 'No addict would keep exact records of his consumption.', 'The figures can therefore only be estimates.', 'As the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out in  Ong Lee Koon & Anor v PP     [1995] 2 SLR 750   , the amount consumed will also depend on the purity of the heroin in each supply.', 'One cannot therefore assess the daily consumption with precision.', 'Nevertheless an assessment must be made; if indeed part of the drugs found in the possession of an addict was for his personal consumption then the accused would not be trafficking in such part (see:  Ong Ah Chuan v PP     [1981] 1 MLJ 64   ).', 'The accused`s evidence was that the 24 sachets with him on 6 July 1994 were the entire amount of heroin he had.', 'He said he carried all the heroin he had on his person because at the construction site where he was staying there was no secure place where he could store his valuables.', 'It was in evidence that the CNB had raided the accused`s mother`s house and found nothing incriminating.', 'They had, however, not raided the Pasir Ris site.', 'In the absence of such a raid, we would not know for sure whether the accused`s claim that he had no other stock of heroin was true.', 'It was, however, a plausible claim and the accused`s evidence that it was necessary to carry all valuables with him as there was no secure place at the Pasir Ris site to store valuables was supported by the evidence of Sanusi.', 'I accepted the claim as true.', 'The total amount of diamorphine in the 24 sachets (including the two half sachets) was 28.36g.', 'Each sachet would therefore contain about 1.2g of diamorphine (28.36 [divide] 23).', 'From the 24 sachets the accused would, in two weeks, consume between 14g of diamorphine (if he consumed 1g per day) and 16.8g (if he consumed one sachet) per day.', 'On these figures the amount of diamorphine that he was trafficking in would be between 14.36g and 11.56g.', 'To avoid the death penalty it is not necessary that the accused must satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the amount he was trafficking in was 15g or less.', 'It is sufficient that he does so on the balance of probabilities.', 'This he has succeeded in doing.', 'I find that in respect of the 24 sachets the accused was trafficking in less than 15g but more than 10g of diamorphine.', 'Accordingly, I amend the charge against him by deleting the words `24 packets of substance containing not less than 28.36g` and substituting therefor the words `not less than 10g and not more than 15g` and convicted him on the amended charge.', 'For trafficking in that amount the penalty prescribed in the Misuse of Drugs Act is a minimum of 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a maximum of 30 years and 15 strokes.', 'Bearing in mind the accused`s age and his personal circumstances, I sentenced him to 23 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.', 'At the commencement of the hearing a charge against the accused that he had consumed heroin was stood down.', 'Upon being convicted on the amended charge, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge of consuming heroin.', 'For that charge I sentenced him to one year`s imprisonment and ordered that the sentence run concurrent with the sentence on the amended trafficking charge.', 'Order accordingly.', 'New South WalesDistrict Court                                CITATION:     R v Robert PAVAN [2009] NSWDC 82

HONOUR: Robert Pavan pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of cocaine.', 'Encompassed within that offence were three separate transactions, each involving approximately a kilogram of cocaine.', 'In each case the offender’s role was to identify purchasers of that large quantity and facilitate the supply of that cocaine from a Mr Big to someone who would then on-supply the drug, perhaps then in turn to others in the chain, before the drug was ultimately distributed to users.2 The offender’s conduct extended over a relatively short time, but it was nevertheless gravely criminal.', 'The offender took a significant role in the drug supply transactions, identifying purchasers and supervising the supply and payment.', 'It is accepted that he must receive a significant period of imprisonment in order to reflect the criminality of his conduct.', '3 He is now sixty years of age.', 'He has some criminal history but there is nothing remotely approaching the seriousness of his present offending.', 'His previous criminal history seems to have been related to his conduct involved in the racing industry.', 'There were tendered today an impressive series of references from friends and family.', 'It appears that the offender is in many respects a man of good character.', 'He is prepared to go very much out of his way to assist his friends and family and has for many years been devoted and dedicated to his family’s upbringing.', '4 When his first wife left he took over the sole care of his three children.', 'He remarried but his second wife also left at about the same time that his daughter’s marriage broke down.', 'In those circumstances his dedication to his children and grandchildren has been far beyond average.', 'He managed to reach fifty-six years of age with only minor matters on his criminal history.', 'That is testament to his underlying character and suggests among other things that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, and is unlikely to re-offend due in no small measure to the substantial support he will receive on release from custody.5 The offender became involved in these transactions after meeting a man by the name of Hatfield.', 'He was one of the Mr Bigs I referred to earlier.', 'Hatfield together with two others, Leslie Mara and Michael Hurley, were involved in large-scale cocaine importation and distribution.', 'Having a large quantity of cocaine in their possession, they needed to sell it for profit.', 'Part of that process required the identification of prospective purchasers and the handing over of the cocaine and the receipt of money.6 The offender said that he owed on Hatfield’s behalf a significant sum of money, and that Hatfield suggested that one way that the money could be recouped was if the offender became involved in the first of the transactions.', 'That was the supply of a kilogram of cocaine to two men, Hinch and Dowe, on 23 February 2005.', '7 It was the offender who caused Mr Dowe to be recruited to the chain of drug supply.', 'To put matters more clearly, it was the offender who identified Dowe as a prospective purchaser and then made arrangements for the handing over of the cocaine and the receipt of the money.', 'The offender was present when the actual transaction took place, supervising it and making sure that all went to plan.', 'How the offender was able to identify someone who wanted to buy a kilogram of cocaine was not made clear.8 The other two transactions were broadly similar in that the offender identified a Mr Stephens as someone who was involved or interested in obtaining two kilograms of cocaine.', 'On two separate occasions the offender arranged the supply of about a kilogram of cocaine to Mr Stephens for the payment of significant sums of money.', 'These transactions would likely not have taken place were it not for the offender’s involvement.', 'He had a very significant role in what occurred.9 Rather than sentencing him according to labels such as “principal” or “courier”, I will sentence him for what he has done and that is, as I have described earlier, obtaining the purchaser, arranging transactions and supervising them.10 The offender was himself using cocaine at the time.', 'A suggestion that he was not a user at the time appearing on one of the reports appears to be a mistake, but this was not a case of a user dealer becoming involved in drug transactions simply to facilitate his or her drug use.', 'This was a case of an offender involving himself in large scale drug supply for financial advantage, even if that financial advantage may have been relatively small.11 The offender said that he spent the money he received on living expenses.', 'That the offender would involve himself in such serious criminality just to help his living expenses is puzzling, especially given the age at which he first committed this serious offence.', 'He explains that it was at a time of some crisis in his life.', 'His second marriage had just broken down, as had his daughter’s.', 'That scarcely explains what occurred.', 'Marriages break down with regularity.', 'People find themselves at times of crisis for all manner of reasons.', 'Yet very few of them supply three kilograms of cocaine as a result.', 'Certainly the offender was at a low point when he committed these offences, but it does not explain what he did in any way.12 Since being arrested on 9 May 2005, the offender has performed very well in custody, and that is consistent with what I described as his underlying character.', 'He has expressed what he described as remorse and contrition both in relation to the effect of drugs in the community, and also to the effect of his incarceration on his family, a matter which I gather is of great concern to him.13 As I mentioned the offender pleaded guilty.', 'The question of the appropriate discount to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea is somewhat complicated.', 'The matter has something of a history, part of the complication in this matter arising from the conduct of the law enforcement authorities and various challenges to that, going all the way to the High Court.', 'It is not necessary for me to recount that history.14 In broad terms, the authorities say that for a plea at committal the appropriate discount is one of twenty-five per cent.', 'For a plea at first arraignment in this court, the appropriate discount is fifteen per cent.', 'Because of the complicated nature of the present proceedings, this is a matter where the discount should be somewhere in the middle.', 'The utilitarian value of the plea is somewhere in the middle of those two circumstances I have mentioned.', 'I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.15 The seriousness of this offence is obvious from the way I have described it.', 'It is also made clear by the fact that the maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment.', 'That is an appropriate reflection of the terrible consequences of conduct of this kind, where people with seemingly no or little regard to the lives and welfare of other citizens involve themselves in large scale drug transactions for financial advantage.', 'Also demonstrating the seriousness of the offence is the fact that it carries with it a standard non-parole period of fifteen years.', 'That, of course, is not of direct application because of the plea of guilty but it reminds as a guide post to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case.16 It of course is appropriate to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and of course the “range” is not a single point.', 'I am satisfied that it is appropriate to describe the three transactions in this offence as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.', '17 Many others involved in these drug transactions have been sentenced, one of them by me.', 'Of course, their conduct and their subjective circumstances were different, but I have been referred to the sentences imposed on Dow, Finch and Stephens in the course of the submissions.18 The principles of parity do apply, such that I should ensure that the offender is not left with a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon the others.', 'As I said, there are many differences between their cases and this, the most important of which is that the offender was involved in three separate transactions, more than Finch, Dow or Stephens.', 'It is significantly more serious for the offender to have involved himself in the further supply of one kilogram when comparing the sentence imposed upon him to the sentence I earlier imposed upon Stephens.', 'The supply of a kilogram of a dangerous drug such as cocaine is not something lightly set aside and ignored.19 It is important to emphasise also that it is not a simple case of, on three occasions the offender doing a single illegal act.', 'Each time he facilitated the supply of drugs, many separate acts were required, negotiating, planning and organising the deal.', '20 There has been no challenge to the submission on behalf of the offender that I would find special circumstances.', 'This will be his first time in custody.', 'The sentence I will impose upon him must necessarily be lengthy and he will be assisted by support upon his release from custody.', 'It is appropriate that the sentence date from 9 May 2005, the day on which the offender was arrested.21 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment.', 'I set a non-parole period of seven and a half years.', 'This will expire on 8 November 2012, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.', 'I set a total sentence of twelve years.', '**********                        \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t       \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tDISCLAIMER - Every effort has

'The Accused is 81 years old.', 'There are a number of health issues which affect the Accused, understandably, because of the circumstances in which he finds himself and given his age.', 'The Accused is presently detained in the Long Bay Hospital Wing.', 'I would expect that he will remain there for the duration of a trial.', 'Senior counsel for the Accused has informed the Court that the timetable which has applied for the purpose of bringing the Accused to Court, and then back to Long Bay, is a lengthy and onerous one.', 'He is woken at 4.00 am for the purpose of being transported with other persons to various courts by 10.00 am.', 'There is no complaint about that aspect, which may be unavoidable.', 'The difficulty lies at the end of the day, when present experience in the course of the pretrial hearing has been that the Accused is taken from Court after 4.00 pm, with the Corrective Services transport taking him via the Downing Centre and then Silverwater, ending up at the Long Bay Hospital Wing at about 10.00 pm.', 'At that time he is provided with a meal.', 'The Court is well aware of the demands on the Correctional authorities with respect to the management of Correctional Centres and transport of persons between Correctional Centres and Courts.', 'However, the primary concerns which I have are not only that the Accused is in a fit state on the days that he comes to Court, but that if there be any problem with respect to his health, this could impact adversely upon the administration of justice in the conduct of the trial.', 'This is to be trial by jury.', 'I want to minimise the prospect of there being any interruption of a jury trial because of practical matters, of which this is an example.', 'The present Accused is in a very unusual category.', 'He is of an age that is highly uncommon for a person who is to stand trial for serious offences in this Court.', 'It may be that factors of that sort are contributing to him being housed at the Long Bay Hospital Wing rather than in the general run of a Correctional Centre.', 'It is my strong recommendation to the Department of Corrective Services that steps be taken to transport the Accused to and from Court each day by the most expeditious means possible.', 'If this means a special transport arrangement because of his age and circumstances then that, in my view, would be highly desirable.', 'I understand, as I have said, that there are many demands on the Correctional authorities.', 'However, a process of bringing the Accused to and from the Court each day so that the trial can proceed without interruption, and with the Accused being in the best state of health possible, are very important matters.', 'Accordingly, I make a strong recommendation to the Department of Corrective Services that steps be taken to transport the Accused each sitting day from the Long Bay Hospital Wing to Court and back by the most expeditious process possible (preferably by way of separate escort).', 'I will cause this judgment to be settled urgently.', 'A copy of it will be provided to the parties.', 'I will also direct that it be provided to the relevant Correctional authorities, and also to the persons administering the Long Bay Hospital Wing in which the Accused is being housed.', 'It may be that those persons have a view on this aspect, as well, which will inform a conclusion with respect to it.', '**********   \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t       \\t\\t\\t \\t\\t\\t\\tDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply

reserved.', 'Andrew Phang Boon Leong\\xa0JA (delivering the judgment of the court): Introduction 1\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in  Public Prosecutor v V\\xa0Shanmugam\\xa0a/l\\xa0Veloo and another   [2015] SGHC 33  (“the Judgment”).', 'The appellant in Criminal Appeal No\\xa02 of 2015, Mohd Suief bin Ismail (“Suief”), is a 48-year-old Singaporean who was convicted of trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of a common intention with V\\xa0Shanmugam\\xa0a/l\\xa0Veloo (“Shanmugam”), the appellant in Criminal Appeal No\\xa03 of 2015.', 'When both appellants (collectively referred to as “the Appellants”) were convicted at first instance, the Judge found that their involvement was probably restricted to the acts described in s\\xa033B(2)(a)( i ) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap\\xa0185, 2008 Rev\\xa0Ed) (“MDA”), namely, the transporting, sending or delivering of the drugs in question.', 'The Public Prosecutor certified that Shanmugam had substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.', 'Shanmugam was thereafter sentenced to the mandatory life imprisonment and to 15\\xa0strokes of the cane under s\\xa033B(1)( a ) of the MDA.', 'The Public Prosecutor did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance as regards Suief.', 'Having also failed to adduce any psychiatric evidence to establish that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, the alternative sentencing regime under s\\xa033B of the MDA was inapplicable and Suief was sentenced to suffer the penalty of death.', '2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We dismissed Shanmugam’s appeal against his sentence given that the Judge had already imposed the mandatory  minimum  sentence allowed under s\\xa033B(1)( a ) of the MDA, which is a term of imprisonment for life and 15\\xa0strokes of the cane.', 'In so far as Suief’s appeal against his conviction and sentence were concerned, we reserved judgment after hearing arguments from the parties.', 'We now deliver our judgment on Suief’s appeal and the reasons for our decision.', 'The facts 3\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On 28\\xa0October 2011, Shanmugam, on the instructions of one Puni (“Puni”), drove a Perodua Kenari, with the registration number JLT\\xa08467, from Malaysia to Singapore.', 'It appears that Shanmugam and Suief had arranged to meet at a bus stop outside Haw Par Villa.', 'Based on the evidence before the court, Shanmugam and Suief were introduced to each other through Puni.', 'Before 28\\xa0October 2011, they had only met each other once at the carpark of the McDonald’s outlet located at West Coast.', '4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Appellants gave differing reasons for meeting each other on 28\\xa0October 2011.', 'Shanmugam said that he was instructed by Puni to hand over the car to Suief, before collecting it thereafter to drive the car back to Malaysia.', 'It appears that prior to this, Shanmugam was already in an arrangement with Puni, where he would drive the car from Malaysia to Singapore, hand it over to Puni’s friend, and then drive the car back to Malaysia after Puni’s friend returned the car.', 'In his long statement, Shanmugam stated that he was offered RM$7,000 per month for carrying out the aforementioned arrangement.', 'In contrast, Suief gave evidence that they were only meeting casually and that Shanmugam had offered to buy him lunch.', '5\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It appears that CNB officers were already on surveillance at that point in time when Suief was spotted carrying a haversack on his way to the bus stop outside Haw Par Villa.', 'After Suief boarded the car, Shanmugam continued driving.', 'It is not disputed that the car made several turns, stopped by a hilltop car park at the National University of Singapore, before arriving at an Esso petrol station along Pasir Panjang Road.', 'The Prosecution’s case is that the Appellants were aware of CNB officers tailing them and had deliberately driven around in a random manner in an attempt to lose the CNB officers.', 'This was, however, denied by the Appellants in the course of the trial.', '6\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At the Esso petrol station, Shanmugam stopped the car next to the air pump machine.', 'At this juncture, one of the Appellants went to the convenience store of the petrol station to purchase drinks.', 'Both Shanmugam and Suief each claimed that  he  was the one who had gone into the convenience store.', 'In this respect, one of the CNB officers who had been tailing the Appellants at that point in time, Inspector\\xa0Sea Hoon Cheng, testified that it was Suief who had gone into the convenience store.', 'Shanmugam, however, maintained that  he  was the one who went to purchase drinks from the convenience store.', 'In any event, it appears that the Appellants subsequently returned to the car, where the black wrapped bundles containing diamorphine were then placed in Suief’s haversack.', 'From the evidence, it appears that the Appellants were both involved in placing the black wrapped bundles into Suief’s haversack.', '7\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The car left the petrol station at about 12.12pm and went along Pasir Panjang Road and West Coast Highway.', 'It finally stopped at a car park located at Block\\xa0405 Pandan Gardens (“Blk\\xa0405”).', 'Suief was seen leaving the car and walking towards Blk\\xa0405.', 'He was spotted carrying a black plastic bag with a golden logo.', 'After Suief left the car, the CNB officers moved in to arrest Shanmugam, who was still in the car at that point in time.', 'Suief’s haversack, with three black bundles inside, was found on the floor mat of the front passenger seat.', 'Two black plastic bags and one newspaper wrapped bundle were also found in the haversack.', '8\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Meanwhile, Suief was arrested outside unit #13-34 of Blk\\xa0405, which turned out to be his mother’s flat.', 'The black plastic bag with a golden logo was, however, not with him when he was arrested.', 'The CNB officers combed the entire block and eventually found it among some flower pots on the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floors.', 'Three newspaper wrapped bundles containing diamorphine were found in the black plastic bag.', '9\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0All the drug exhibits were subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority, where they were analysed and found to contain not less than 28.5g of diamorphine.', 'The charge 10\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Appellants were charged for trafficking in diamorphine in furtherance of the common intention of both parties.', 'Given that the actual charge was not reproduced in the Judgment, for ease of reference, the respective charges are set out as follows:   YOU ARE CHARGED  at the instance of [the PP] and the charge against you is: That you, [V\\xa0SHANMUGAM\\xa0A/L\\xa0VELOO / MOHD SUIEF BIN ISMAIL], on the 28 th \\xa0 day of October 2011, at or about 12.06\\xa0p.m., together with one [Mohd Suief Bin Ismail/V\\xa0Shanmugam\\xa0A/L\\xa0Veloo ...], and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class\\xa0A of the First Schedule to [the MDA], to wit, by transporting from the Esso Station along Pasir Panjang Road to the carpark of Block\\xa0405 Pandan Garden, inside a motorcar bearing registration number JLT8467, ten (10)\\xa0packets containing 4497.7\\xa0grams of granular/powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain  not less than 28.50\\xa0grams of diamorphine , without authorization under [the MDA] or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section\\xa05(1)(a) of [the MDA] read with section\\xa034 of the Penal Code (Cap,\\xa0224, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under section\\xa033 and 33B of [the MDA].', '[emphasis in original] The decision in the court below 11\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0At the conclusion of the Prosecution’s case, the Judge observed that the identity of the two persons in the car was not disputed (see the Judgment at [10]).', 'He found that the Prosecution had established the fact that the diamorphine in question was in the possession of the Appellants when they were in the car and that they had transported the diamorphine from the Esso petrol station to Pandan Gardens with the common intention of trafficking in the drugs (see the Judgment at [10]).', 'The Appellants were therefore called upon to enter their defence.', '12\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Before the Judge, the Appellants denied having any knowledge that the bundles contained drugs and claimed that they had no common intention of trafficking in drugs.', 'Each appellant attempted to pin the blame on the other appellant.', 'Their defence was rejected by the Judge, who found that the Appellants had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking in the drugs found in their possession (see the Judgment at [14]).', '13\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0After hearing the evidence, the Judge was satisfied that the Appellants knew that the black plastic bags contained diamorphine and that they had acted with the common intention of trafficking in them in the manner of Suief dropping part of them ( ie , the three bundles in the black plastic bag) off at Blk\\xa0405 (see the Judgment at [20]).', 'The Appellants were therefore found to be guilty and were convicted as charged.', '14\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On the issue of sentencing, the Judge found that the involvement of the Appellants fell within the scope of s\\xa033B(2)(a)( i ) of the MDA.', 'The Public Prosecutor granted a certificate of substantive assistance to Shanmugam, but not Suief.', 'As a result, Shanmugam was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15\\xa0strokes of the cane, while Suief was sentenced to suffer the penalty of death.', 'The arguments Suief’s arguments 15\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It will be recalled that Suief’s defence at first instance was an outright denial of knowledge that the black plastic bags contained diamorphine.', 'In the present appeal, however, the primary argument was that Shanmugam and Suief did not share a  common intention  to traffic in  all ten bundles  of diamorphine.', 'Counsel for Suief in the present appeal, Mr\\xa0Ramesh Tiwary (“Mr\\xa0Tiwary”), submitted that the evidence adduced in the course of the trial supported Suief’s account that he was going for his Friday prayers after dropping by his mother’s house and that he had no intention of returning to the car.', '16\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In this regard, Mr\\xa0Tiwary highlighted that the only evidence which demonstrates that Suief had intended to return to the car came from Shanmugam.', 'It was submitted that Shanmugam’s evidence in this regard was “so inconsistent and contradictory” that it was insufficient to establish the element of common intention beyond reasonable doubt.', 'In support of this proposition, Mr\\xa0Tiwary relied on a number of inconsistencies and contradictions in Shanmugam’s evidence, both in court and out of court (for example, the police statements that were given by Shanmugam).', 'It was also argued that Shanmugam’s evidence was clearly self-serving as he had repeatedly tried to distance himself from the drugs in question by attempting to pin the entire blame on Suief.', '17\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0To this end, Mr\\xa0Tiwary submitted that the Prosecution’s case, taken at its highest, only demonstrated that Suief had intended to deal with the three bundles that were subsequently recovered from Blk\\xa0405.', 'As highlighted above, it was argued that Shanmugam’s evidence that Suief had intended to return to the car after dropping off the three bundles should be disbelieved.', 'Mr\\xa0Tiwari also submitted that there was no other evidence to show that Suief had anything to do with the seven bundles left in the car.', '18\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the course of the hearing before us, Mr\\xa0Tiwary confirmed that Suief was prepared to be convicted of trafficking in the three bundles of drugs in the black plastic bag that was recovered from Blk\\xa0405.', 'He conceded that based on the evidence led at first instance, the defence of ignorance, which was relied upon by Suief at the trial below, was almost inevitably bound to fail.', 'To that end, he submitted that we should set aside Suief’s present conviction and convict Suief of the amended charge of trafficking in the three bundles of drugs in the black plastic bag.', 'Under the amended charge, Suief would not be liable for the death penalty given that the amount of diamorphine in the three bundles did not justify the imposition of the death penalty.', 'The Prosecution’s arguments 19\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The Prosecution relied on two main arguments in response to Suief’s case.', 'First, Mr\\xa0Lau Wing Yum (“Mr\\xa0Lau”), who appeared on behalf of the Prosecution, highlighted that the charge was in relation to the transportation of  all ten bundles  of diamorphine “from the Esso Station along Pasir Panjang Road to the carpark of [Blk\\xa0405], inside a motorcar bearing registration number JLT8467”.', 'On this basis, it was immaterial whether Suief had intended to return to the car after leaving the three bundles of diamorphine at Blk\\xa0405, in so far as the Appellants had the common intention to traffic the drugs from the Esso station to Blk\\xa0405.', 'The Prosecution also cited the decision of this court in  Syed Feisal bin Yahya v Public Prosecutor   [1992] 1\\xa0SLR(R) 853  for the proposition that where a person transferred drugs from one place to another for the purpose of ultimate distribution and not for personal consumption, even if he did not part with or transfer possession of the drugs to another person, the act of conveyance amounted to trafficking by  transportation .', '20\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Second, Mr\\xa0Lau also relied on the following evidence in support of the Judge’s finding that the Appellants had the common intention to traffic the drug exhibits by transporting them from the Esso petrol station to Blk\\xa0405: (a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0There was no discernible reason for Shanmugam and Suief to meet on the material date apart from transporting the drugs in question.', 'The joint enterprise to transport the drugs in the present case could be inferred from Suief’s agreement to meet Shanmugam and to remain in the car from the Pasir Panjang bus stop to the Esso petrol station, and finally to Blk\\xa0405.', '(b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The common intention to traffic the drug exhibits could be inferred from Suief’s active participation in the transferring of the bundles, starting from his decision to bring the haversack from his home to contain the drug exhibits, to his handling of the drug bundles in the car while parked at the Esso petrol station, and his agreement to help Shanmugam bring the black plastic bag with the golden logo from the car to the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floor of Blk\\xa0405.', '21\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Apart from that, the Prosecution also referred to the decision of this court in  Wong Kok Men and another v Public Prosecutor   [1994] 3\\xa0SLR(R) 463 , where the earlier decision (also of this court) of  Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor  [1979-1980]\\xa0SLR(R) 53 (affirmed in  Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor  [1979-1980]\\xa0SLR(R) 710) was cited for the proposition that the offence of trafficking will be made out if a quantity of drugs is transported from one place to another, and the transporter’s purpose, whether it is achieved or not, is to part with possession of the drug or  any portion of it  to some other person whether already known to him or a potential purchaser whom he hopes to find.', 'It was further argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the drugs in question were for Suief’s personal consumption.', 'The Prosecution also pointed out that Suief did not make any such assertion and that he had tested negative for any illicit drugs including diamorphine.', 'The issue 22\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The central issue in the present appeal centres on the fact that Suief is advancing a different legal defence on appeal.', 'More importantly, this different defence is  inconsistent with  the defence he had proffered in the court below.', 'Put simply, he is arguing that there was no common intention between the parties to traffic in  all ten bundles  (as opposed to his defence of ignorance that was relied upon in the court below).', '23\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As we have highlighted above, Mr\\xa0Tiwary conceded (correctly, in our view, and for the reasons set out by the Judge in the Judgment) that the appeal was bound to fail based on the defence that Suief had run in the court below ( viz , a blanket denial of knowledge that the bundles contained the drugs concerned ( viz , diamorphine)).', 'As a result, Mr\\xa0Tiwary ran a  completely different case  before this court.', 'Put simply, the Appellant’s case was that, whilst he did indeed know that the bundles contained drugs, he had  no common intention  with Shanmugam to traffic in  all ten bundles  of drugs.', 'He submitted that he only had the ( individual )  intention  to traffic in the  three bundles  of drugs he had taken out of the car with him in the black plastic bag and which he had, in fact, placed behind the flower pots at the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floors of Blk\\xa0405.', 'It was argued that on this basis, Suief should be liable only for trafficking in  three bundles  of drugs, which was a  non -capital offence in so far as the amount of diamorphine in the three bundles fell below the minimum statutory amount for the death penalty to be imposed ( ie , 15g of diamorphine, with reference to the Second Schedule of the MDA).', '24\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We note, at the outset, that Suief is now running a case before this court which is  inconsistent with  that which he had run before the trial court.', 'It would be appropriate to first set out the applicable principles with regard to a situation where an accused person attempts, in the course of  an appeal , to rely upon a defence that had  not  been advanced in  the trial court .', 'The applicable principles 25\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The question of whether an accused person is allowed, in the course of an appeal, to rely upon a defence that has not been advanced at first instance has been considered in a number of local decisions.', 'In  Mohamed Kunjo v Public Prosecutor  [1977-1978]\\xa0SLR(R) 211 (“ Mohamed Kunjo ”), a decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Singapore Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant was accused of causing the death of the victim by striking the latter on the head a few times with an exhaust pipe.', 'The High Court found the appellant guilty of murder and sentenced him to death.', 'On appeal, his conviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal.', 'Before the Privy Council, the appellant sought to rely on the defence of sudden fight, which had not been raised either during the course of the trial or before the Court of Criminal Appeal.', 'Hence, the question that arose was whether the defence of sudden fight could be raised for the first time before the Privy Council, given that it had not been mentioned in the judgments of the High Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal.', 'The Privy Council made the following instructive observations (at [19]–[20]), which we find useful to reproduce in full as follows: 19\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Where trial has been by jury and the burden of proof is upon the Prosecution to negative the defence, it is settled law that the judge must put to the jury all matters which upon the evidence could entitle the jury to return a lesser verdict than murder.', 'And, if the judge fails to do so, the Board will intervene, even if the matter was not raised below.', 'For otherwise there would be the risk of a failure of justice.', 'In\\xa0 Kwaku Mensah v R \\xa0 [1946] AC\\xa083 , Lord\\xa0Goddard, giving the reasons of the Board for allowing the appeal, said, at\\xa094: The principles on which this Board acts in criminal cases are well known and need no repetition, but when there has been an omission to place before the jury for their consideration a matter of such grave importance that they were never led to consider whether in this respect the prosecution had discharged the onus which lay on them of proving murder as distinct from manslaughter, their Lordships think that they can properly entertain the appeal.', 'They would add that it must be seldom that they consider a matter which was not only not mentioned in the courts below, but was not included in the reasons given by the appellant in his case.', '20\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Although different considerations arise where, as here, the burden of proving the defence or exception is upon the defendant and trial is by judge (or judges) alone, Mr\\xa0French for the Public Prosecutor has not contended either that s\\xa0105 of the Evidence Act, or the mere fact of trial being by judge alone, precludes the Board from considering a defence not raised below.', 'But he does raise the point that it does not follow from a judge’s silence as to a possible defence that he has ignored it.', 'He may have thought the matter too plain for argument – more especially, if it has not been raised by the Defence.', 'Moreover it would not, in our judgment, assist the administration of criminal justice if there were to be cast upon the High Court the duty of reciting in judgment only to reject every defence that might have been raised but was not.', 'Nevertheless there will be cases in which justice requires the Board to consider matters not mentioned in the court below.', 'It is to be noted that in India, where there is also no trial by jury and the burden of proving the exception of “sudden fight” is upon the defendant, the Supreme Court of India has considered and given effect to the exception, substituting a verdict of culpable homicide for one of murder, although the exception had not been relied on at trial: see\\xa0 Chamm Budhwa v State of Madhya Pradesh  AIR\\xa01954 SC 652.', 'In our judgment a defence based upon an exception which the defendant has to prove may be raised for the first time before the Board, if the Board considers that otherwise there would be a real risk of failure of justice.', 'The test must be whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could find the defence made out.', 'If there be such evidence, the court of trial should have expressly dealt with it in its judgment and the Judicial Committee will deal with it on appeal, even though it has not been raised below.', '[emphasis added] It therefore appears that a defendant is, strictly speaking, not precluded from relying upon a defence that is raised for the first time on appeal.', 'On the facts of  Mohamed Kunjo , however, the Privy Council was of the view that the evidence led was such that  the High Court  could  not  have reasonably concluded that the defence of sudden fight was made out.', 'The appeal was therefore dismissed on that basis.', 'This last-mentioned point underscores an extremely important (and closely related) point which ought to be emphasised – in ascertaining whether or not an alternative defence raised by an accused person for the first time on appeal ought to be considered, the appellate court  will have regard  only  to the evidence which had been led  at the trial itself  in order to ascertain whether  that defence  was  reasonably available on the evidence  before the court  at the trial .', 'The importance of this point cannot be overstated.', 'Let us elaborate.', '26\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Indeed, whilst the courts afford maximum flexibility to accused persons in establishing their respective defences (particularly in capital cases), this does not mean that they can “reserve” arguments that they can resort to on appeal.', 'It is incumbent that  all  parties proffer  all  the arguments which they wish to rely upon at the trial itself.', 'This is consistent with, for example, the substance and spirit of the rule underlying (albeit in a slightly different (but not wholly unrelated) context) the duty of disclosure placed on the  Prosecution  in the decision of this court in  Muhammad bin Kadar v Public Prosecutor   [2011] 3\\xa0SLR 1205 .', 'However, no system is perfect and hence it is possible that there could be  alternative defences  that could  also  have been reasonably available and therefore relied upon by the accused person based upon  the evidence adduced  at the trial itself .', 'In fairness to the accused person, he or she should  not  be precluded from raising such an alternative defence  on appeal  if it was  reasonably available on the evidence  before the court  at the trial itself .', 'Indeed, it is important to reiterate a point already noted in the preceding paragraph – that, in  Mohamed Kunjo , the evidence led  at the trial  itself was such that  the trial court  could  not  have reasonably concluded that the defence of sudden fight (raised for the first time on appeal before the Privy Council) was made out.', '27\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Returning to the relevant case law, the Privy Council decision of  Mohamed Kunjo  was subsequently cited by this court in  Public Prosecutor v Mas Swan bin Adnan and another appeal   [2012] 3\\xa0SLR 527  (“ Mas Swan ”).', 'This last-mentioned decision is not only a recent authority but is also important in illustrating (as does  Mohamed Kunjo ) how the general principles set out above apply in concrete fact situations.', '28\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In  Mas Swan , two accused persons, Mas Swan and Roshamima, were jointly charged with importing diamorphine into Singapore from Malaysia after they were apprehended at the Woodlands Checkpoint with three bundles of diamorphine concealed inside the front left door panel of the vehicle they were travelling in.', 'At first instance, Mas Swan’s defence was that he knew the three bundles contained controlled drugs, but believed them to be ecstasy pills because Roshamima had told him so.', 'Meanwhile, Roshamima’s defence was that she did not know of the  existence  of the three bundles concealed in the front left door panel.', 'The trial judge accepted Mas Swan’s defence and acquitted him of the charge of importing diamorphine.', 'The trial judge convicted Roshamima of the offence of importing diamorphine after finding that she had knowledge of the three bundles containing controlled drugs in the front left door panel of the vehicle.', 'The trial judge also found that Roshamima had not discharged the burden of rebutting the presumption of knowledge under s\\xa018(2) of the MDA.', '29\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On appeal, this court found that the trial judge had erred in law in not considering the possibility that Roshamima might also have believed that the three bundles contained ecstasy pills as this was what she had told Mas Swan.', 'It was held that the fact that Roshamima had adopted an “all or nothing” defence ( ie , denial of any knowledge of the existence of the three bundles concealed in the left front door panel) should not have deprived her of any other available defence (such as the defence that she had believed the three bundles to contain ecstasy pills) that could reasonably be made out on the evidence available at the trial itself.', 'It was further observed that it was not unreasonable of Roshamima  not  to rely (at least more vigorously) on the alternative defence at the trial itself because relying on that defence would inevitably have impacted the cogency or strength of her primary defence, which, if successful, would have resulted in her being acquitted of the capital charge (it should be noted that counsel for Roshamima  did , in fact, refer to the alternative defence at the trial, although, in the words of this court, he “failed to advance [the alternative defence] in a more dogged manner” and “appeared to have retreated from pursuing this defence after persistent questioning by the [trial judge] regarding the logic of his position in the light of Roshamima’s “all or nothing” defence” (see  Mas Swan  at [23])).', 'As a result, given that it was impossible to say what the Judge’s decision would have been if he had considered the alternative defence, it was held that Roshamima had to be given the benefit of the doubt arising from the trial judge’s omission to consider that defence.', 'Roshamima’s original conviction was set aside on that basis, and she was thereafter convicted of an amended charge that reflected her belief that the three bundles contained ecstasy pills.', 'In arriving at this outcome, this court made the following observations (at [75]–[76]) with regard to the earlier decision of  Mohamed Kunjo : This principle is well-illustrated by\\xa0[ Mohamed Kunjo ], a Privy Council decision on an appeal from Singapore.', 'In that case, the appellant did not raise the defence of sudden fight to a charge of murder either at his trial or on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.', 'The question was whether the defence could be raised before the Privy Council for the first time.', 'Consistent with the line of authorities which we referred to earlier, the Privy Council reasoned that in a jury trial, the trial judge must put to the jury all matters which might reasonably entitle the jury to return a lesser verdict (see  Mohamed Kunjo  at [19]).', 'If the trial judge failed to do that, the Privy Council would intervene.', 'The Prosecution in  Mohamed Kunjo  did not suggest that this principle was inapplicable where there was a bench trial or where the burden was on the accused to establish his defence (which was the position in  Mohamed Kunjo  by reason of the Evidence Act (Cap\\xa05, 1970\\xa0Rev Ed)).', 'The Privy Council also referred to an Indian decision involving a bench trial in which the Supreme Court of India substituted a verdict of culpable homicide for one of murder because it found that the special exception of sudden fight was made out notwithstanding that this special exception was not raised during the trial (see\\xa0 Chamru Budhwa v State of Madhya Pradesh \\xa0AIR\\xa01954 SC\\xa0652).', 'On the facts of\\xa0 Mohamed Kunjo , the Privy Council considered that the evidence was such that the trial judges could not have reasonably concluded that the defence of sudden fight was made out.', 'This was because the accused had taken undue advantage of the victim (see\\xa0 Mohamed Kunjo  at [21]).', 'Accordingly, the Privy Council held that the trial judges did not err in failing to refer to that defence in their judgment.', '30\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The court had also observed thus (at [74]): The trial judge cannot shirk the responsibility of considering any  alternative defence  reasonably available on the evidence before the court  even if the Defence has not relied on that defence, or even if the Prosecution and the Defence have agreed not to raise it.', 'In a criminal trial, the court’s duty and function should not be constrained by any agreement between the Prosecution and the Defence not to raise a particular defence before the court.', '[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] The above observation embodies the  general principles  applicable to the present appeal (as to which see also above at [25]−[26]).', 'However , some elaboration (or, rather, qualification) is, in our view, required in respect of the above observation from the words “or even if the Prosecution” (in the first sentence) to the end of the observation itself (hereinafter referred to as “the latter portion of the court’s observation”).', 'In particular, we would add that, if the parties have so agreed not to raise a particular defence, they should not be leading evidence pertaining to that defence anyway.', 'If one party attempts to lead such evidence (inadvertently or otherwise), the other party would probably object or at least point out to the court that the evidence is irrelevant in the light of their agreement.', 'In that situation, the court would certainly rule that the evidence is irrelevant.', 'It would, therefore, be  extremely unlikely  that such evidence would be adduced, or, if inadvertently led but ruled irrelevant by the court, that it should still be considered by the court in relation to the agreed excluded alternative defence.', '31\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Further, however, if one party adduces evidence that is  contrary  to the agreement, the other party may decide not to raise any objection because it is obviously irrelevant in the light of their agreement.', 'The other party may thereby be lulled into not challenging that evidence and finding no need to adduce any evidence to the contrary because it believes that the evidence is irrelevant according to their agreement.', 'In such a situation, it would, in our view, not be fair for an appellate court to find that the trial judge did not consider an alternative defence based on the evidence before the court because that would\\xa0put the trial judge in an invidious position.', 'To elaborate, if the trial judge considers an alternative defence based on the evidence, one party may submit that he is wrong because of the agreement and because it has been led to believe that the evidence was irrelevant and therefore did not challenge it.', 'The trial judge would also not have heard any submissions on the alternative defence before he decided the issue because both parties have agreed not to raise it.', 'However, if\\xa0the trial judge does not consider the alternative defence, he would, in turn, be criticised by the other party and by the appellate court for not having done so.', '32\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are therefore of the view that the latter portion of the court’s observation has  overstated  the trial judge’s duty and function.', '33\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0This would be an appropriate juncture to apply the principles set out above to the facts of the present appeal.', 'Our decision 34\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We begin by observing that the issue before this court is whether it is now open to Suief to invoke the  alternative  defence that he had no common intention with Shanmugam to traffic in all ten bundles of the drugs concerned ( viz , diamorphine) and that he only had the (individual) intention to traffic in three bundles of drugs (which were recovered from the staircase landing between the seventh and eighth floor of Blk\\xa0405) instead (see also above at [23]).', 'As we have already noted above, his (alternative) defence is, of course, wholly  inconsistent  with the defence which had been proffered in the court below,  viz , an outright denial of knowledge that all the black plastic bags contained the drugs.', 'The key issue that arises for our decision in this particular regard is whether or not  the alternative defence being proffered in the present appeal was reasonably available to Suief based upon the  evidence  at  the trial  itself .', '35\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  It is clear that Suief had    not    given    any    evidence    in the course of the trial itself    which could support the alternative defence presently being proffered in this appeal .', 'He had, instead, taken the position that he did not know that all the bundles contained diamorphine.', 'As we have already noted, this last-mentioned defence was rejected by the Judge in the light of the evidence that had been led.', 'Indeed, Suief’s evidence  at first instance  was  wholly inconsistent  with his  current  position that he had intended to traffic in only three bundles of diamorphine.', 'It is clear, in our view, that there was  no evidence whatsoever in the court below which would lead to the conclusion that the alternative defence was reasonably available to Suief .', '36\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is, in fact, clear, in our view, that the (alternative) argument proffered by Suief is  a mere afterthought .', 'It was a last-gasp, desperate, as well as opportunistic attempt to evade the death penalty by now confessing liability for only  part  of the ten bundles of drugs ( ie , for the three bundles of drugs that he had taken out of the car in the black plastic bag at Blk\\xa0405).', 'Let us elaborate.', '37\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0First, we refer specifically to the evidence of Shanmugam.', 'His evidence given  before and at the trial in the court below  would be of particular importance simply because he would  not  have been privy to Suief’s  current  argument.', 'It would therefore constitute (contrary to what Mr\\xa0Tiwary had argued) an objective litmus test against which Suief’s current argument can be tested.', 'In this regard, we note especially the  repeated  evidence given by Shanmugam in  both  his written statements  and  his oral testimony in the court below that  he had been  asked by Suief  to  wait in the car  for him  as he ( ie , Suief) went up to his mother’s flat with the black plastic bag containing the three bundles of drugs.', 'There was, in the nature of things, no reason whatsoever for Shanmugam to lie or embellish the evidence in this particular regard.', 'Indeed, it was a mere description of what had factually taken place and did not appear to even constitute the crux of Shanmugam’s case in the court below.', 'However (and this is the crucial point), it is  dispositive  of Suief’s current argument.', 'As Mr\\xa0Tiwary himself candidly admitted (correctly, in our view) during oral submissions before this court, if it could be demonstrated that Suief would be  returning  to the car, that would  completely undermine  his argument to the effect that he had nothing to do with the remaining seven bundles of drugs and was only concerned with the three bundles in the black plastic bag which he had purportedly taken up to the thirteenth floor of Blk\\xa0405 (but which he had, in fact, hidden behind the flower pots at the staircase landing of that same block between the seventh and eighth floors).', '38\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We would also add that even  Suief’s  own evidence does  not  support the case now made before this court.', 'It is, for example, undisputed that he had brought  a virtually empty haversack  along with him (it had only contained, and only in the front compartment of the haversack at that, a pen, an open box of cigarettes and a lighter).', 'By the time, however, Shanmugam and Suief had arrived at Blk\\xa0405, the haversack  contained all ten bundles of drugs (three of which were taken out and placed in the black plastic bag which was then taken out of the car by Suief and subsequently hidden behind the flower pots at the staircase landing of Blk\\xa0405 between the seventh and eighth floors) .', 'Indeed, if, as Suief argued, his sole purpose was to take  only  the three bundles of drugs in the black plastic bag  and he had nothing to do with the remaining seven bundles of drugs, then why did he not simply put  the three bundles  of drugs  in his haversack  and leave the remaining seven bundles of drugs in the black plastic bag instead ?', 'Whilst it could be argued that Suief had generously given the haversack to Shanmugam, this argument is weak at best.', 'Indeed, as we have already held, the evidence (by Shanmugam) was that he ( ie , Shanmugam) was  waiting  for Suief  to return to the car .', 'This would explain why the Appellant left his haversack containing the seven bundles of drugs in the car with Shanmugam.', '39\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It is also clear, in our view, that Suief was in fact  Shanmugam’s contact in Singapore .', 'If, as Suief has argued, his  sole  purpose was to meet Shanmugam in order to obtain the three bundles of drugs in the black plastic bag (and  no more ), that would have left Shanmugam with the remaining seven bundles of drugs  and no further instructions as to how he was to dispose of those remaining bundles of drugs .', 'We have, however, already held that the evidence demonstrates that Shanmugam was in fact  waiting  for Suief to return to the car, which is wholly consistent with the point just made that Suief was Shanmugam’s Singapore contact and would assist in disposing of the seven bundles of drugs accordingly.', '40\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Turning to Suief’s own  statements , his statement dated 20\\xa0December 2011 (Exhibit\\xa0P\\xa0141) is particularly instructive.', 'In it, he specifically stated that “the  7\\xa0packets of drugs  do not belong to me” and that “I also do not know that the  7\\xa0packets  contained drugs at that point in time” [emphasis added].', 'Whilst it could be argued that Suief had not invoked the alternative defence now before this court at that particular point in time, it could at least  equally be argued  that Suief was indeed concerned with  all remaining seven bundles of drugs  at that particular point in time inasmuch as, instead of disassociating himself from them, he had actually mentioned them specifically.', 'This last-mentioned point is of course now confirmed by our finding above to the effect that the evidence clearly demonstrates that Shanmugam had been  waiting  in the car for Suief to return after he had left temporarily with three bundles of drugs in the black plastic bag at Blk\\xa0405.', 'Indeed, as we have already emphasised, this is a crucial finding that completely undermines Suief’s alternative argument before this court.', '41\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We also find Suief’s  phone records  to be indicative of the fact that he was the Singapore contact who was responsible for communicating directly with Puni.', 'Based on the evidence that has been led in the course of the trial, Puni appeared to be using the phone number +60164978192.', 'It was stored in Suief’s phone memory as “Boyz”.', 'For present purposes, we will focus on the incoming and outgoing calls that were made to and from Puni on the day Suief and Shanmugam were arrested,  ie , 28\\xa0October 2011.', 'In so far as the phone records that were obtained from Singtel were concerned, Suief had numerous short phone conversations with Puni prior to his arrest:   Incoming/Outgoing     Time     Duration     Incoming     08:40:35     00:00:17     Incoming     10:26:16     00:00:10     Outgoing     10:52:17     00:00:19     Outgoing     10:52:46     00:00:09     Incoming     10:54:05     00:00:18     Outgoing     10:55:58     00:00:16     Incoming     10:56:23     00:00:28

Incoming     11:58:11     00:00:08     Incoming     12:06:08     00:00:27   When Suief was cross-examined with regard to these phone calls that he had had with Puni, he was evasive with his answers, as can be seen in the exchange reproduced as follows: Q: You see the number 6016478192?', 'That is Puni’s number, isn’t it?', 'A: I think so, I cannot recall.', '… Q: So now your casual friend [referring to Puni] you are making this same day, so many calls, then at 8.40 again, there was another incoming call.', 'On the 28th---now we go to the 28 th  [ ie , the day of the arrest].', '8.40am, there was an incoming call from Puni to you.', 'Can you see that?', 'A: Yes.', 'Q: Now we go to the first page---second page.', 'At 10.26am, Puni makes a call to you.', 'A: I think so but I cannot recall.', 'Q: Then at 10.52, you call Puni twice.', '10.52 within a---30 seconds, you call Puni twice.', 'A: Yes, on that day, I did---I think---I think I did talk to him.', 'Q: Okay.', 'Then at 10.53, there’s an incoming call from Puni to you.', 'Then at 10.55, there’s an outgoing call from you to Puni.', 'Then at 11.02--- A:   We only had casual talks.', 'Q: So 11.02, there’s another outgoing call from you to him.', 'So within 10.55, 11.02, within 7\\xa0minutes you have made two calls to him.', 'A:   I cannot recall.', 'Q: Now after this, at 11.03, you made an outgoing call to the accused, 1st accused [ ie , Shanmugam].', 'But you have told the Court, the 1st accused call you.', 'It was you who called the 1st accused.', 'He never made a call to you.', 'A: That is not true, he was the one who called me, Your Honour.', '… Q: All right.', 'We will now go back to the first page---we’ll go to the first page.', 'At 11.36, you made a call---you received a call from Puni, isn’t it?', 'A: I think so but I cannot recall.', 'Maybe---maybe I did talk to Puni but we didn’t talk--- Q: What was that--- A: ---much.', 'Q: ---what was that you all were talking about?', 'A:   We are friends, we jokes together.', 'Q: Okay.', 'A:   So it’s nothing for us to phone each other.', 'Q: Okay.', 'Then you call again, he calls you at 11.56, within 20\\xa0minutes.', 'A:   These calls are nothing.', 'We joke around every day.', 'He will call me, I will also call him so it’s nothing.', 'Q: Okay.', 'Now, at 11.58---all this is while you are moving around in the car, isn’t it?', 'All these calls are while you are moving around with his car?', 'A: Yes.', 'Q: The final call is made at 12.06.', 'So isn’t that a coincidence, Mr\\xa0Suief?', '12.06 is the time the Kenari is supposed to have left the Esso station.', 'A:   I did talk to Puni and informed him that I was going for my Friday prayers.', 'I didn’t say anything else, that was what I told him.', 'Q: No, it is an incoming call.', 'It’s not you who called him, he called you.', 'A: Yes.', 'He called him.', 'Q: So it is not you called him and told him about Fri---your Friday prayers, he called you.', 'Why was there a frequent calls from 11.36 to 12.06 from Puni?', 'A:   It was nothing, Your Honour.', 'We just had casual talks, I informed him that I was going for Friday prayer.', '[emphasis added in bold italics] Notwithstanding Suief’s attempts at evasion, it is clear (as is evident from Suief’s own responses during cross-examination) that he had in fact spoken with Puni.', 'Examining the evidence as a whole, Suief’s evidence that he merely had “casual talks” and was only joking with Puni appears to be implausible.', 'In so far as the telephone records set out in the extract above are concerned, a total of  13\\xa0phone calls  were made between the parties in a short time span of under two hours.', 'In fact, the duration of each phone call was relatively short, and most of the phone calls were under 20\\xa0seconds.', 'In the circumstances, Suief’s evidence that he and Puni were merely speaking casually and joking around simply does not make any sense.', 'We are instead of the view that Suief had been communicating with Puni directly for the purposes of discussing the drug deal and potentially to receive instructions from Puni in that regard.', 'This lends further support to our finding above that Suief was responsible for distributing the drugs in Singapore.', '42\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the final analysis, we are of the view that Suief’s arguments in the present appeal were without merit in so far as they were not supported by the evidence led  in the course of the trial .', 'In fact, as we have explained above, the evidence available demonstrates  the precise opposite  inasmuch as it goes towards showing that Suief was the point of contact in Singapore, as opposed to Shanmugam (who was mainly responsible for transporting the drugs across the border from Malaysia to Singapore).', 'The telephone records obtained from Singtel also demonstrate that Suief was continuously in contact with Puni throughout the entire morning of 28\\xa0October 2011, up until Shanmugam and Suief were both arrested by the CNB officers.', 'In this regard, it is not disputed that Puni was the main contact point for the drug transaction and that he was responsible for introducing the Appellants to each other.', 'Coupled with the evidence that demonstrates that Suief intended to return to the car after dropping off the black plastic bag (containing the three bundles of drugs) at Blk\\xa0405, we cannot accept Suief’s argument that he had only intended to traffic in the three bundles of drugs.', 'Indeed, the relevant evidence in the court below is  completely contrary  to this particular argument.', 'Conclusion 43\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For the reasons set out above, we dismiss Suief’s appeal against his conviction.', 'Given that the Public Prosecutor has not granted a certificate of substantive assistance to Suief, the alternative sentencing regime under s\\xa033B of the MDA is inapplicable.', 'Suief’s appeal against his sentence must therefore fail, given that the amount of diamorphine involved requires the imposition of the mandatory death penalty.', \"Cycle and Carriage Motor Dealer Pte Ltd v Hong Leong Finance Ltd [2004] SGHC 274     Case Number   :   DA

( [2004] SGDC 105 ).\", 'It concerned the actionability for conversion of a Preferential Additional Registration Fee (“PARF”) certificate.', 'In the court below, the learned district judge held that a case for conversion was successfully made out by the respondent and ordered the appellant to pay $92,710.00 with interest and costs fixed at $2,526.05.', 'After hearing the appeal by the appellant on 13\\xa0September 2004, I dismissed it with costs fixed at $3,500.00.', 'Before I set out the grounds for my decision, the following facts are not in dispute.', 'Agreed facts 2 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The respondent purchased one second-hand Mercedes Benz S280 AT bearing the registration number SCK\\xa08028A (“the vehicle”) from Hiap Hoe Motor Trading Co (Pte) Ltd. On 15\\xa0September 2000, the appellant entered into a hire purchase agreement with one Ang Eng Hian (“Ang”), for the amount of $110,000.00.', 'Ang was the registered owner of this vehicle.', '3 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  At all material times, the respondent retained possession and custody of the Vehicle Log Card and Certificate of Entitlement (“COE”).', '4 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  A number of events occurred on 18\\xa0October 2000.', 'The vehicle was deregistered.', 'The Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) issued PARF certificate no\\xa00034376XP0000, for the deregistration.', 'The PARF carried a rebate value of $92,710.00.', 'On the same day, one Huang Wei Duan, trading as E-Type Motoring, sold the PARF certificate to the appellant for the sum of $92,710.00.', 'The appellant proceeded to use the PARF certificate for the registration of a Mercedes E280 Elegance that was purchased by Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd (“Starwood”).', '5 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The PARF certificate was transferred to Starwood, and its value offset the payment of the additional registration fee, quota premium and registration fee for Starwood’s new Mercedes E280 Elegance.', '6 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  What is also not disputed by the parties is that the appellant was not aware of the existence of the hire purchase agreement or circumstances which led to the deregistration of the first vehicle.', '7 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  On 18\\xa0August 2003, the respondent claimed against the appellant the sum of $92,710.00 being damages for conversion of the PARF certificate.', 'It also brought an alternative claim for money had and received, but this was not pursued at trial or on appeal.', 'In this appeal, I only have to address the issue of the claim for conversion in respect of the PARF certificate, and why it should succeed in this case, as found by the learned district judge.', '8 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  An explanation of the special circumstances surrounding car hire purchase transactions and vehicular ownership in Singapore would set the issue in some context.', 'Here I rely on the learned district judge’s lucid explanation at [10] of her judgment: In Singapore, the [moneys] disbursed under hire purchase agreements for cars cover various distinct property interests: the value of the physical chattel, expressed as Open Market Value (‘OMV’), a [ten-year] licence to own the car, being the Certificate of Entitlement (‘COE’), and a Special Registration Fee (‘ARF’).', 'These properties also have distinct transactional values.', 'The car could be sold for parts or exported in whole.', 'COE and ARF have a surrender value calculated upon their unexpired remainder tenure.', 'For cars with COEs registered before May 2002, the PARF rebate is a percentage of the OMV, with the percentage varying with the age of the car.', 'For cars registered with COEs obtained after May 2002, the PARF rebate is a percentage of the ARF, with the percentage varying with the age of the car.', 'This rebate may be used to offset the taxes and fees of a new car, in particular, the ARF, the COE Quota Premium and the Registration Fee.', 'The value of the rebate is evidenced by the PARF certificate issued at time of deregistration.', 'The PARF certificate may be transferred and is widely traded.', '9 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The noteworthy point about PARF certificates is that they represent a rebate value, which may offset taxes and other fees.', 'I would also add that although the PARF certificate may be transferred and is widely traded, its value is determined by reference to the previous vehicle for which it was issued, even if this was done at the point of deregistration.', 'In the peculiar circumstances of vehicular ownership in our country, I agree with the learned district judge’s observations that PARF certificates provide evidence of what is actually the surrender value of a vehicle upon deregistration.', 'When the PARF certificate comes into existence, after a hirer breaches the terms of his hire purchase agreement and deregisters the vehicle in question, it would follow that the vehicle’s surrender value also crystallises at the point of the breach.', 'Against this factual matrix, I would conclude that it is simply not practicable as a matter of law to separate the PARF certificate from the vehicle under hire purchase.', '10 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  I turn now to the action in conversion in respect of the PARF certificate.', 'Ingredients of the conversion action in this case 11 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The form of conversion referred to in this case is summarised in  Halsbury’s Laws of England  vol\\xa045 (4th\\xa0Ed, 1985) para\\xa01422, that “there must be a positive wrongful act in dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner’s rights, and an intention in so doing to deny the owner’s rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them”.', 'The passage goes on to state that there need not be any knowledge on the part of the person sued that the goods belong to someone else; nor need there be any positive intention to challenge the true owner’s rights.', 'Fraud is not a necessary ingredient.', 'Goods may be the subject of successive and independent conversions by persons dealing with them in such a manner and with such an intention.', '12 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  In summary, the learned district judge held as follows: (a) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The PARF certificate is a chattel that is capable of conversion.', 'The value of it is the face value of the certificate.', '(b) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The fact that the appellant had no knowledge of the intervening fraud ( ie  Ang’s breach of the hire purchase agreement) and was a  bona fide  purchaser of the PARF certificate for value, is not material to the present proceedings.', 'Dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner’s rights, and an intention in so doing to assert rights that are inconsistent with the owner’s, are sufficient.', '(c) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Once the physical document, the PARF certificate, came into existence in the course of Ang’s breach of his hire purchase agreement, the respondent had an immediate right of possession of it.', 'The PARF certificate formed an integral part of the motor car.', 'From the outset, the hire purchase company owns the surrender value of a car, and this is evidenced by the PARF certificate.', 'Issues in the appeal 13 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  In the appeal before me, I could not perceive any serious challenge to the first two findings.', 'The PARF certificate is a chattel that evidences a chose in action.', 'It is capable of conversion.', 'The learned district judge drew a correct analogy with cheques, which have been held to be capable of conversion:  Kleinwort, Sons & Co v Comptoir National D’Escompte de Paris   [1894] 2 QB 157 .', 'I was referred to the following passage in  Lloyds Bank, Limited v The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China   [1929] 1 KB 40  at 55: Conversion primarily is conversion of chattels, and the relation of bank to customer is that of debtor and creditor.', 'As no specific coins in a bank are the property of any specific customer there might appear to be some difficulty in holding that a bank … had converted its customer’s chattels; but a series of decisions … have surmounted the difficulty by treating the conversion as of the chattel, the piece of paper, the cheque under which the money was collected, and the value of the chattel converted as the money received under it … 14 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  This is well-settled law.', 'The appellant tried to argue that the “surrender value” is not a subject matter that is capable of conversion.', 'The learned district judge was clearly referring to the immediate right to possession of the physical certificate, once it came into existence following Ang’s breach.', 'It is perfectly acceptable proposition for the respondent to argue, as it has done, that as a cheque, the PARF certificate is a piece of paper (of value).', 'It may form the subject matter of conversion proceedings.', 'I also make reference to  Exklusiv Auto Services Pte Ltd v Chan Yong Chua Eric   [1996] 1 SLR 433 .', 'An action for conversion of a COE was dismissed on the ground that there was no evidence that the COE was the property of the appellant in that case.', 'What is implicit is that COEs are capable of being the subject matter of conversion.', 'The same should hold true for PARF certificates.', '15 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Equally obvious is the irrelevance of the appellant’s knowledge of Ang’s breach of the hire purchase agreement.', 'As set out in the passage on conversion that is summarised in  Halsbury’s Laws of England  ([11]  supra ), such knowledge is immaterial.', 'This passage has been referred to in  UCO Bank v Ringler Pte Ltd   [1995] 1 SLR 713 .', '16 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The appellant argued that the consequence of holding that an innocent party may be liable for conversion of a PARF certificate issued by the LTA would be that any person purchasing PARF certificates is potentially liable for conversion.', 'This is not true in every case.', 'Conversion actions can be avoided if proper inquiry is made of the claim of title of the vehicle and its accompanying certificates, such as COE and PARF.', 'There is no credible suggestion that a finding against innocent parties, as in the case, would provide companies such as the respondent with limitless actions for conversions.', 'Once an order for damages is made following the determination of liability, the claimant is compensated for his entire interest in the chattel.', 'His title is extinguished, and the parties move on.', '17 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The principal question, upon which a conversion action succeeds or fails, is to identify who had the immediate right to possess the subject matter of conversion.', 'A breach of any hire purchase agreement would give the hire purchase company the right to immediate possession of the car and to maintain an action for conversion: see  North General Wagon & Finance Co Ld v Graham   [1950] 2 KB 7 .', '18 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  In the present appeal, the court had to determine who had the immediate right to possess the PARF certificate at the time the PARF certificate was issued pursuant to the deregistration of the vehicle.', 'Was it Ang or the respondent?', 'The appellant submitted that it was Ang who had the immediate right to possess the PARF certificate.', 'It challenged the learned district judge’s conclusion that the respondent had the immediate right to possess the PARF certificate at the time it was issued, and therefore the respondent had the right to maintain an action against the appellant for conversion of the certificate.', '19 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The appellant did not dispute that the respondent had the immediate right to possess the vehicle (as opposed to the accompanying documents) if there was a breach of the hire purchase agreement.', 'This is apparent from cl\\xa09 of the agreement.', 'With respect to the PARF certificate, it argued that the immediate right to possess the PARF certificate vested in Ang, for two reasons.', 'Firstly, the hire purchase agreement does not provide for the immediate right to possess the PARF certificate, or the rebate value that it represents.', 'Secondly, it was argued that Ang had the immediate right to possess the PARF certificate by the operation of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Registration and Licensing) Rules (Cap\\xa0276, R\\xa05, 1999\\xa0Rev Ed) (“the Rules”).', 'The appellant argued that r\\xa08(3)(a) provides that the “applicant” for the PARF rebate “has to be or has been the registered owner” of the motor vehicle.', 'Rule\\xa02(1) defines the “registered owner” as a person registered under the Road Traffic Act (Cap\\xa0276, 1997\\xa0Rev Ed) (“the Act”) as the owner of the motor vehicle.', 'However, the Act clearly does not envisage “owner” to mean “legal owner”.', 'On the contrary, s\\xa02 of the Act defines “owner” in relation to a vehicle which is the subject of a hiring or hire purchase agreement, to mean the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement.', 'That is not an explicit reference to legal ownership.', '20 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The references to the Rules do not assist the court when determining who has the immediate right to possess.', 'Even where the PARF certificate was issued in Ang’s name by the LTA, by the operation of the Rules, the definition of “owner” in the Act does not in any way vest the immediate right to possess on Ang  per se .', '21 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The most practicable solution is to proceed on the basis that the PARF certificate actually forms part of the vehicle that is subject to hire purchase arrangements.', 'I bear in mind the following factors: (a) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Without the PARF and COE, a vehicle cannot be used on the roads of Singapore; (b) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The value of the PARF certificate is directly related to the age of the motor vehicle; (c) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The PARF value is directly related to the ARF paid upon the registration of the motor vehicle; and (d) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  The PARF certificate is issued by the LTA after the motor vehicle is deregistered.', '22 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Within the scheme of the Act and the Rules, the PARF certificate, like the COE, is inextricably linked with the vehicle.', '23 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  An appropriate analogy may be drawn with conversion actions that are brought in respect of vehicles that are sold together with licences of value.', 'The case of  Douglas Valley Finance Co Ltd v S\\xa0Hughes (Hirers) Ltd   [1969] 1 QB 738  is instructive.', 'Licences known as special “A” licences were attached to certain lorries that were subject to hire purchase arrangements.', 'The effect of the special “A” licences was that they substantially increased the value of the motor vehicles.', 'A series of transactions caused a severance of the special “A” licences from the lorries, which resulted in a diminution in their value.', 'This led to an action by the plaintiff against the defendant for conversion of the licences.', 'The court held that these licences were so much appurtenant to the vehicles that without them the vehicles could not be used for their designated purpose and the licences substantially affected their value.', '24 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  By parity of reasoning, once a PARF certificate or COE is taken away from a motor vehicle, the latter can no longer be used for its intended purpose within our legislative framework.', '25 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Inasmuch as the respondent was the legal owner of the vehicle (under the hire purchase arrangement), it was also the legal owner of the PARF certificate.', 'Accordingly, the right of immediate possession vests with the respondent.', 'It is the respondent who can legitimately maintain an action for conversion in respect of the PARF certificate.', 'The fact that the PARF certificate is only issued at the stage of deregistration does not affect this principle.', 'I agreed with the learned district judge when she reasoned that from the outset the respondent, as the hire purchase company, owned the surrender value.', 'The right to the PARF rebate crystallised from inception.', 'The value at any point during the hire purchase depended on such facts as the age of the vehicle and its Open Market Value.', 'Once the PARF certificate was issued, the respondent held an immediate right of possession of it.', '26 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Once chattels have been let on hire purchase terms, it is trite that the hirer does not acquire any better title than a possessary one.', 'No proprietary interest will vest in the hirer until he has made his last payment and exercised his option to purchase.', 'Until the hirer undertakes these final steps, the  nemo dat  rule will prevent him from transferring a better title.', 'I fail to see how any rule of law or equity can operate to vest to the hirer the immediate right of possession of the PARF certificate, thereby excusing the appellant from any liability for conversion.', '27 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  For the above reasons, I was of the view that the PARF certificate can in fact form the subject matter of conversion, and was in fact converted by the appellant when it used the certificate to offset the registration fees for its customer, Starwood.', 'I accordingly dismissed the appeal, with costs of the appeal fixed at $3,500.00.', 'Appeal dismissed with costs.']\n"
